title: Places on the internet
---
Date: October 2022

I tend to easily forget about cool places on the internet I find in favor of "large roads"; nothing wrong with reading NYT or HN; I just take a certain joy in visiting online gardens which feel individually kept, like going to the same bookshelf of a library or same beach shore to always find something new.

I would go as far as to say this is the reason I started the website (as well as the name of it: gallery of unclosed tabs). I've made a habit of periodically skimming the tabs on my phone, closing them and making sure I note down any cool webpages I might want to return to.

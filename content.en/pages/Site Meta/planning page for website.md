## General
### statement
space for hosting my content online.
An online garden, which is cultivated by content I find myself sharing most with people in my life. Collection of information I would like to invite people into.

Ideally, should be easy/usable enough that I could offer non-technical people in my life with setting one up themselves.

Must be lean, corporate-free. Maybe hosted on a co-op server ([riseup.net](https://riseup.net/en())

### process
ideally, the note-taking process (or at least a pre-defined subset) would flow directly to being published.
Something like:
* obsidian sub-dir
* on trigger(save) or cron pushes to github
* which publishes to the website. 

^ not sure whether the above process would support 

based on the title alone, probably something like [this](https://www.gatlin.io/content/how-i-use-obsidian-as-a-cms-for-my-website)

### legacy/alternatives
another idea would be travel advice/travel journal. I would need to keep a journal anyway, would be interesting to also keep an externally-facing one.

### ideas 
it could be cool to have a little monologue attached to certain pages. Maybe just read the page as an article, with some sound effects in the background? That alone seems like a good start.

Think of how you used to explain things to newcomers at voltus - channel that energy of explaining things to new folks - sharing your knowledge and excitement
## problems to solve 
- [x] floating menu currently sucks/is slow. Consider using https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31954089/how-can-i-reuse-a-navigation-bar-on-multiple-pages ✅ 2025-01-04
- [x] obsidian pipeline ✅ 2025-01-04

## tech stack
potential alternatives

- [[website with hugo]]
-  [[raw HTML website, but with markdown -> HTML processor]]
### deprecated
fully hand-crafted html and CSS... the overhead is too great?

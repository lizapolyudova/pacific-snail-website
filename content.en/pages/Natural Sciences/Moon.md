## phases of the moon

Explaining phases of the moon is one of my favorite things to do; given that I have on hand:
* a flat surface
* 3 objects. If I am lucky, with round top-down cros-section.
* (optional): ideally, daylight to have accurate shadows

It is not uncommon that the explanation happen in proximity of a dinner table. so something like:
* large yellow plate for the sun
* salt/pepper shakers for moon and earth 
work great. 

<!--insert picture of animation here-->

### the basics
* new -> waxing crescent -> waxing quarter -> waxing gibbous -> full
* full -> waning gibbous -> waning quarter -> waning crescent

### playing with the model

**Here are some fun facts to establish:**
* new moon rises and sets at the same time as the sun
* solar eclipse will only ever happen during a new moon
* lunar eclipse will only happen during a full moon

**Follow-up question**s:
* what time would you expect to observe the moon at its highest position during phase X? 
* [place "moon" in a random position around its orbit around the "earth"]
	* what time does it rise/set?
	* what's the phase of this moon?

## declination

Declination in itself is a simple idea: it's the vertical angle between the (line doing directly up? Idk the name)

So sun declination through the year ranges from 23N to 23S

Moon is more sporadic due to its angled orbit. There's an 18 year cycle which changes max declination from to 28.smth

> important to note here is the following distinction: declination is an earth-global value; independent of where you are on earth. It will **affect** the max altitude observed at a given latitude; however, max altitude is impossible to reason about without knowing the latitude

<!--include an illustration or a visual here?-->

[This is such a good explanation](https://www.umass.edu/sunwheel/pages/moonteaching.html) for moon standstills (kinda fully cuz some quotes are in all caps, but gotta appreciate their dedication to lack of other types of emphasis) 
Some outtakes: 
- moon does in a month what sun does in a year ( in terms of it's movement in the sky)
- there is an 18 year long cycle in which the "amplitude" moon monthly declination fluctuates (so 9 years between major and minor lunar standstill. Pictured above)

Specifically. You can think of it as: on years when we are close to a minor lunar standstill. No matter how hard the moon tries, it will always be kinda barely rolling along the horizon. 
Whereas on major standstill years each month the moon will have low and high days. Some higher than the sun could ever reach. 
Not trying to be dramatic, it just kinda comes out that way. 
I think we are close to a major standstill next year

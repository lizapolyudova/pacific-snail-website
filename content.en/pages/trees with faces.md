title: trees with faces
---
The concept is simple: they are trees which look like they have faces. I went through a portion of my life seeing them everywhere (in retrospect, it was a lonely time, maybe my face recognition bit was just overly eager). Nonetheless, here are some trees with faces.

If you want to make a submission of a tree with a face, send it to pacific.snail@protonmail.com

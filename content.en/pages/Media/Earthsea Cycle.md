I recently went back and read Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea cycle; What I find interesting is that she didn't write all 5 books in one sitting - and that maturity distance really shows. The first 3 books are really adventure-focused, very classically male-hero (even if imbued with elegant and heartfelt wisdom) driven; all written in the span of 4 years - 1968 ro 1972. Then there's a 4th book fully focused on a heroine who was a magical being in book 2 but pursued a "simple life" and is now more or less going through a midlife crisis and questioning her place in society and her past. Not much novel time has passed, but this no longer feels like a young adult adventure novel; published in 1990 - 18 years after the 3rd book, those who grew up with the first 3 books now would be ready to face quite different questions.

Still haven't made my way into the last few books, but figured I'd share; there's a strange sense of loss for myself as a young teen who didn't get to experience it then. I am glad I got to it now and excited for how much more there is in the world for me.

## naming things
Finally, here's a quick quote I really love from the book (for quick context: Ged is the protagonist, in his early teens and is apprentice to a somewhat reclusive wizard named Ogion. I think here they are out walking in the mountains. Ogion is also very quiet and Ged gets impatient feeling like he is not learning anything from his master).

> Mastery is nine times patience. What is that herb by the path?' 'Strawflower.' 'And that?' 'I don't know.' 'Fourfoil, they call it.' Ogion had halted, the coppershod foot of his staff near the little weed, so Ged looked closely at the plant, and plucked a dry seedpod from it, and finally asked, since Ogion said nothing more, 'What is its use, Master?' 'None I know of.' Ged kept the seedpod a while as they went on, then tossed it away. 'When you know the fourfoil in all its seasons root and leaf and flower, by sight and scent and seed, then you may learn its true name, knowing its being: which is more than its use. What, after all, is the use of you? or of myself? Is Gont Mountain useful, or the Open Sea?' Ogion went on a half mile or so, and said at last, 'To hear, one must be silent.‚Äù

For one, it does have a very fairytale-like quality to it. But I love the three points being made there:

- to know a name of a plant, animal or being means nothing in itself. So easily curiosity can be dispelled with learning of a name for a word, phenomenon, being. But name is only the beginning of knowing something. The thought keeps me coming back
- the lightness with which a human being is compared with that of a plant somehow makes life feel easier. After all, there is no use, is there? Simple answer - "none that I know of". Not that there isn't a use, just the humility to admit of not knowing one
- and, finally, there's the "to hear, one must be silent". Like anything true, the phrase rings out into space and finds its way somewhere close, right behind the top of my forehead. I think of the moment when you are walking through a forest and the only thing you seem to hear is yourself panting and stepping on the ground. Then for a moment - stop. Not always to admire the view of the mountains; sometimes, just to look around - close your eyes and feel what the world is with you right in the middle of it.

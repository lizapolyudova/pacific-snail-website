## Intro
12-episode sci-fi/fantasy series focusing largely on biodiversity of an alien planet with many elaborate visuals featuring circle-of-life type mini-stories.

I again watched in on recommendation (thanks, Jess :) 

## Mood and themes
The mood is colorful and full of wander. Yet pretty dark. It is dreamlike, but bound by its own internal logic. 

The wolrd-building is surreal and (assuming you suspend your disbelief and desire for "hard sci-fi") 
 
## Outtakes
(spoilers ahead)
Here are some themes that spoke to me:

* Levi's character arc. I was going to say "transformation", but who are we to say how much they actually transformed; rather, their character is revealed through the series. First time they lead Azi into a beautiful oasis as a refuge from the storm, Levi points out structures they've made. Levi is making art - because it feels necessary. I loved that



* Creatures are not inherently evil; they are largely just trying to survive. Someone pointed out that the series opens with Sam cutting guts from a monster which we later see decomposing a few episode later. In the end - Sam dies consumed by a parasite for their own needs. Who is evil really? They are all just trying to survive in the best way they know how to, with tools available to them. Some creatures are hostile and dangerous to others, all are bound by the necessity to continue living

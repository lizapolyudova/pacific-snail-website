## General Makerspaces

### batiment7
[Batiment7](https://ateliers.batiment7.org/#!/) this is the closest to where I live now. Easy access in the summer. 

* super responsive over email!
* cool history: community got together a group and resisted this building being bought by a developer to be torn down/be converted to for-profit housing. They are now surrounded by condos from this developer :) however, it's a very inspiring story.
* have gone to the "supervised sessions" at the ceramics studio and it was a wonderful time! Went with a friend, me got some clay and had a great time making for 3 hours or so. 
* has gone a few times to the woodworking supervised sessions, as well. The person there 
* have a membership option, which asks that you spend certain number of hours supervising workshops, as well as participate in at least one of the committees.
* have a grocery store and sometimes free food :) 
* lots of events and classes. they also have an [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/batiment7anous/?hl=en)


### Lespacemaker

[lespacemaker](https://www.lespacemaker.com/) - membership around 80/month. They have workshop and cool facilities including ceramics, silkscreen printing, metalwork, woodwork etc. Very mature/organized


### Foulab
* [foulab](https://foulab.org/calendar/) haven't been, but seems much more relaxed and is free. Been wanting to go to an event there for a while now

### LaRemise
(toolshed lol)
* [LaRemise](https://laremise.ca/) haven't been, but a friend uses their tool library extensively and has done sewing classes/used their sewing space and really enjoyed it

### LesAffutes
* [LesAffutes](https://www.les-affutes.ca/en/)lots of cool workshops in both english and french. I've gone for a woodworking thing as "team building" for work and that was super fun. 
	* woodworking workshop was very well organized. good safety techniques, ended up making a final product in just under 3 hours pretty cool!
	* did the basket weaving workshop. Met Katie, who made a really good note: the best part about these workshops is the fact that you come with all the materials prepared, everything is already setup for you. 

## Community Bike Workshops

For all the community bikeshops I've been to (not a lot... but still) the general ethos is - the bikeshop is "staffed" with volunteers who will help you figure out what repairs are needed for your bike given that you come in with a specific issue and will likely guide you through the repair. However, it is generally expected that the person coming in is doing all the actual fixing themselves. I find this a wonderful way to learn and meet other bike enthusiasts

### [SantroVelo](https://santropolroulant.org/en/what-is-the-roulant/collectives/santrovelo/)

Every time I've come in, the volunteers are extremely competent, knowledgeable and willing to help. Very well-stocked and organized. Last time I went: open Tue, Wed 530-730 PM, reservations are needed to come in. Costs 10$ for visit. They sell parts relatively cheap. 

### [the FLAT bike collective](https://theflat.wordpress.com/) 
located in the basement of McGill. Free to visit. Last time I checked was open Tue-Fri 530-730, but better check their website (or instagram which I think is more up to date) for schedule and any special events. Volunteers are largely students. From my experience not always expert advice, but always friendly and welcoming. Well-stocked if a bit chaotic in terms of organization.

We don’t passively forget that something is scary. We actively learn that it isn’t anymore.


Studies like these clarify that the amygdala isn’t about the pleasure of experiencing pleasure. It’s about the uncertain, unsettled yearning for a potential pleasure, the anxiety and fear and anger that the reward may be smaller than anticipated, or may not even happen.

# notes

### testosterone 
Makes one more likely in a way which would maintain a social status. Counter to popular belief, does not increase aggression per se, but makes already aggressive individuals more so

Thus, testosterone’s actions are contingent and amplifying, exacerbating preexisting tendencies toward aggression rather than creating aggression out of thin air. This picture inspired the “challenge hypothesis,” a wonderfully unifying conceptualization of testosterone’s actions.14 As proposed in 1990 by the superb behavioral endocrinologist John Wingfield of the University of California at Davis, and colleagues, the idea is that rising testosterone levels increase aggression only at the time of a challenge. Which is precisely how things work.


### oxytocin and vasopressin

## chapter 2 
### lymbic system 
"Emotion" center
SNS = sympathetic nervous system (4Fs, activation)
PNS = parasympathetic nervous system (deactivation). Calm, vegetative states

#### amygdala
Under the cortex in the temporal lobe.
Aggression and fear 

Inputs:
* Sensory inputs 
* pain
* disgust 

Outputs:
- bidirectional connection
* Hippocampus interface 
* Motor outputs 
* Arousal


### frontal cortex - FC

working memory, executive function (organizing knowledge strategically, and then initiating an action based on an executive decision), gratification postponement, long-term planning, regulation of emotions, and reining in impulsivity

dlPFC - dorsolateral PFC. Most logical. Delayed gratification, planning, impassionate decision making. Decider of decidiers 
vmPFC -ventromedial PFC. Connected with emotions. Empathy 

### mesolimbic / mesocortical dopamine system

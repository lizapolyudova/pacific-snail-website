Podcast by American western media's [Dan Leone](https://laist.com/people/dan-leone) and is an excellent piece of investigative journalism.

I listened to the flow series (of 8 episodes, about 40 minute each) in what feels like one breath (and more realistically was 3 long dark winter evenings).

The tone established by the first episodes makes the narrative line not quite clear, but clearly communicates the intention of a well-researched piece which - rich with personal accounts and the narrator's introspective side notes. 

The podcast focuses on the aftermath of the BP oil spill 13 years after the incident. First taking a closer look at the incident itself, breaking down how the media narrative was controlled, then diving more deeply not just into environmental repercussions, but long term health effects of the people involved in the cleanup, giving equal attention to legal and medical details of their cases. 

In terms of tone, the piece really allows to dive into investigative journalism as a story which develops and takes a life of its own, rather than one that is pre-destined in the eye of the future producer. The final cut includes brainstorming sessions between the two lead reporters talking about not being able to obtain evidence and strategizing how they are going to progress the story, which narrative branch to pursue, the main narrator frequently talks about his process of traveling to someone's house, how it is on the way to someone else's, making connections of people we've already met, people we've already heard mentioned. It creates a beautifully dense fabric of connections and people who all seem to be experiencing the event together apart. It also gives a very believable imitation of investigating - to be taken on someone else's journey of deciding which way to go. be faced with lack of information, be faced with closed door and people who will not talk to you for one reason or another. 

In terms of the content - it was both heartwarming and disheartening. Best stories feel like tapestries - the larger motif revealing itself as you step away and the intricate complexity of each individual story drawing you in as you get close. There are many wonderful personal account of what feels like all possible stages of a journey in this disaster. Fishermen talking about their connection to sea filled with sentiment and yet maintaining their southern masculinity, men and women talking about seeing their loved ones fall sick and die, personal accounts of being sick, the disorientation of it, the extent of lack of information that is shared, many public meetings held with enraged southererns demanding their justice. 

Disheartening... let's talk about that part. The zoomed out picture is unfortunately so depressing the most depressing part about it is how unsurprising it is - BP's conduct and handling on the situation. Not only have they lied and not shared sufficient information during the initial incident, but they have systematically suppressed data in the process of the cleanup and refused to both protected people from the known harm as well as compensate them for the after-effects of the toxic chemicals. 

Terrifying is the amount of power they wield. The level of obscurity a large company is able to introduce into the process in which they control most of the data and the blatant disregard for human lives involved; not by humans within the company necessarily (as there was evidence of safety hazards being raised internally), but by the "corporate entity" as a whole which seems to have few wishes other than to continue its own existence at the expense of others, willing to put on the line anything it deems necessary.

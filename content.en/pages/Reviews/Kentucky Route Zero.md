## intro

## timeline
I started playing on Paul's recommendation.. avoiding thinking about some things (flag-poling, starting job soon, procrastinating on responding to emails)

So far it's very surreal (in act 2 so far)

## act I & II
The interlude between act 1 and 2 included a gallery showing and 3 people interacting with it. One of the pieces is an interactive piece with audiotape glued on a canvas arranged as a narrative you can navigate by rolling the tapehead. for choices instructions are given in "turn n degrees" at crossroads. Such a cool concept. 

As the party is growing, a beautiful gameplay mechanic is introduced in which you play different characters of the party. Sometimes the transition is obvious; other times - less so. 

A favorite scene of mine (I think sometime in act 2) is Shannon and Conway are heading out from the museum after having met Ezra. You can walk around as Conway with his broken leg but once outside a certain range - you seamlessly switch to Ezra, who is initially doing erratic circles around Conway. I found the moment confusing. I went back to find the exact radius, to deconstruct - that's how I often treat magical experiences. 

Then there's the gold skeletons. Like any symbolism introduced early and explored deeper as you get into it, the intrigue, the guessing helps you form your own theories before you are offered an explanation.

Something this game seems to me is a meditation on, a reminder of agency of thought. Sometime in act 3 (I think scene 12) when Shannon and Conway recall exploring where the "strangers" come from, the guide of the distillery is showing Conway the truck. You are inspecting various parts of the truck. There are two options - to comment on the physical property, or the option in *italics* which immerses you in a memory, ignoring completely the ongoing surface-level conversation, treating speech as irrelevant and inner monologue as essential and worth tending to.

It is not infrequent that the game gives you the choice to not listen, to notice, to think about something seemingly tangential. 
It is interesting that little of the narrative changes depending on which conversation options you as the player are choosing. Rather,  you are allowing the characters to feel in different ways - they are the ones you speak for. 

The outcome of the story fatefully cannot be modified. What can be changed is how you as the player experience the reality, the reality you talk about offscreen which is only true in words and yet somehow solidified. There's also the elusive nature of things unsaid - you rarely get to circle back and often times options for dialogue provided are mutually exclusive, non-sequitur which will never allow the conversation to circle back to the same place.

I think this game makes me understand role-playing games. When a boat floats by in the foreground with musicians and a bluesy tune plays. How can I - the character at the top of the stairs casually descend down and rush over to my boat instead of listening? When given the option to leave or "stick around for a while" - I'll pick that sometimes. That's what life feels like at times, it's difficult to leave places behind, to know just when it is time to go.

The first first character you are playing by middle of act 4 is gone. The reason you've started your quest has disappeared - captured by the distillery, drowned by his inevitable debt. The scene accompanying the departure appropriately talks about loss, how people do strange things when they miss someone. I miss him, I wonder whether he is all-right.

## returning to act V
After a long break (I was away in NYC, waiting for my Canadian immigration paperwork to go though) I have returned to Montreal; it feels like the right time to finish the game.

Act 5 is about the choice to rebuild a city which was built among burial mounds. Choice to stay behind for no reason other than chance and being in good company. How appropriate. I am glad I saved it until now. I am really only here because of chance and good company, on a hunch. Hunting something elusive; an inspiration, a feeling once had. 
Good night

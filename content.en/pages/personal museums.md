Home is a place we come to be with ourselves and recharge. Unfortunate as it may be, thinking of ourselves as the technology we interface with - tools for everyday use, is what feels most comprehensible. Home is a place which allows one to bring the battery back to a functioning level, it is a place me bring our barren body to allow us to continue on.

I remember feeling grateful having my own place, my place to enact change and feel my physical power extend to reality in any way that I wish. I had envisioned many projects to decorate my home, to make is special, to make it beautiful.

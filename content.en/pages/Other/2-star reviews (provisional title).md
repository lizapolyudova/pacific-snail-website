About three-fourths of the way through I again find myself opening up GoodReads and checking for reviews. The public has spoken - 4.2 stars, a B minus of a sort. I would be concerned that quality is so one-dimensional for me, that I forever feel tied to the numerical score, but I take comfort that this malaise is a generational characteristic. Comfort. More of a commiserating with my contemporaries, a systemic problem, a tectonic shift in thinking of our generation. Too easy to criticize, impossible to escape; spare me that black mirror episode - I've heard it all before. 

Generational or not - here I am, reading 2-star reviews of another book I have not yet finished, clicking one "read more" after another, questioning my competency as a reader, second-guessing whether I should have disclosed the reading of this book to the progressive friend. In a way, book reviews are a form of prose, a revisiting of the high-school book report genre, but as a consenting adult. 

Not quite the 1-star "If I could give this 0 stars, I would" - they've decided; they don't like it and want nothing to do with this writing; at times - passionately righteous, but rarely misunderstanding. Something in me adores the uncertainty of the 2 stars, the quiet polite disagreement with the common opinion, hesitancy to commit to the dislike - just in case there might have been a misunderstanding. Two stars is how I at times feel about a quiet day with nothing to do - not particularly enjoyable, but nothing is wrong with it, someone else could have liked it instead of me if they were in the mood for it. 

I sink deeper into uncertainty - most of them ring true, it *is* boring at times!

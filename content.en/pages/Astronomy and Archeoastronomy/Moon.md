title: Moon

Im surprised I didn't already have a section for this. I think I finally somewhat understand declinations of the moon. 
Declination in itself is a simple idea: it's the vertical angle between the (line doing directly up? Idk the name)
So sun declination through the year ranges from 23N to 23S

Moon is more sporadic due to its angled orbit. There's an 18 year cycle which changes max declination from to 28.smth


This is such a good explanation for moon standstills (kinda fully cuz some quotes are in all caps, but gotta appreciate their dedication to lack of other types of emphasis) 
Some outtakes: 
- moon does in a month what sun does in a year ( in terms of it's movement in the sky)
- there is an 18 year long cycle in which the "amplitude" moon monthly declination fluctuates (so 9 years between major and minor lunar standstill. Pictured above)

Specifically. You can think of it as: on years when we are close to a minor lunar standstill. No matter how hard the moon tries, it will always be kinda barely rolling along the horizon. 
Whereas on major standstill years each month the moon will have low and high days. Some higher than the sun could ever reach. 
Not trying to be dramatic, it just kinda comes out that way. 
I think we are close to a major standstill next year

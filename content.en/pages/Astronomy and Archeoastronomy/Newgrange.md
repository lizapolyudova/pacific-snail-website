## Context

Newgrange is a megalithic mound, a man-constructed "hill" made of layers of stone and dirt with a single passage aligned with the direction of the sunrise on the day of the winter solstice. The structure predates Stonehenge by approximately 2 thousand years and is located about 1 hour north of Dublin.

As a friend of mine put it 

> was it 3 people who were obsessed with stars? Were they the weird star geeks? Or was it the entire population. I like imagining a while population all evry organized diligently designing astrological ceremonial thing. But in reality most poeple were like "LETS BUILD HUGE STONE AND EARTH THING and then the 1-2% of autistic/nerdy people got obsessed with stars and tracking dates and the other people were like . ok ok that seems like a cool idea and not much extra work. we'll turn the thing around to the point it in the direction you want"

Indeed, one can learn much about the prehistoric society; there are countless books, there's a categorization: Stone Age, Bronze Age, etc. Then each is further subdivided into eras with sufficiently distinct characteristics. Neolithic Age - the last part of Stone Age specifically differs from the one before it [Mesolithic] by introduction of agriculture, domestication of animals and a change from nomadic lifestyle to one that is settlement-base. All those should not come as a surprise - whether the knowledge is sources from middle school history books or games like civilization where skills are neatly laid out as a sequence to cross the Bronze Age threshold.

Yet, the question stands: we don't truly understand that society.

## My visit

I went to Newgrange on the day of the April New Moon in 2023. Took a bus in to Drogheda from Dublin the night before and stayed in a hostel. Was lucky to catch a wonderful couple spending their last evening of working at the hostel, moving on to continue traveling to County limerick near the Burren and Ailwee caves.

I remember meeting some folks at the hostel the night before - it was their last day, sharing some shells I picked up on beaches in count Kerry, since they were heading there next and it seemed like a fun idea to ask them to return a shell to the beach.

First thing on the next day I grabbed a taxi to the Newgrange visitor center, the appointment slot was at 9:30; there was morning traffic and people were getting to work - which seemed absurd in such proximity of a prehistoric site - life goes on. 

I stand in front of the visitor center, 930 deadline seems like a joke now, what is time. I remember a woman in front of me; a face shaped with kindness - her face almost always half-smiling, wrinkles carrying the memory of joyful times of the past, flowing gray hair. We probably chatted for a while, I ran into her and her family a few more times, each time with small talk getting no less small but somehow warming over time.

Newgrange is place that affected me deeply when I went to see it. There are so many themes packed in here:  

* changing from nomadic people to agriculture-focused society  
* tracking time with extreme precision without mathematics or a representative of reality astronomical model (really circling the word "wrong" here).  

I would really like to start exploring these themes in an essay, bullet points, or any other form, really. So far, I've mostly spent my time exploring this conversation through casual conversation with people who care to listen and engage.

## Carrying stones
Pilgrimage of everyday things. 

* I met a woman who told me she picks up stones on the side of the highway and bring them back home to create a pathway in her frontyard
* Newgrange is constructed specifically from stones which were brought over from >50 km away.
* Earlier that day, prior to hearing the story, I have given objects to new friends to be carried on a pilgrimage of their own. Who is to say whether they've completed the journey, but the natural inclination is what is interesting
* Then of course there is Ferdinand Cheval https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Cheval (who told me about him?! was it someone at newgrange? was it Brian? or Paul? who is to say)
## Some relevant snippets

### May 2023
I am thinking about newgrange again. The room I am staying in is an attic apartment. Bed next to a diagonal roof window facing almost directly east. I wake up around 5 each day from the sun (going back promptly to sleep of course). Until 10 or so the sun framed by the window travels across the room. I only have a few more days, but I think I'll track how it progresses through the room, since I have my own personal. "roofbox".

Maybe building of the temple was partly a testament to end of the nomadic lifestyle. Neolithic period (last part of the stone age) is when people started changing from nomadic hunter-gatherers to an agriculture-focused society (citation needed). I wonder how they tracked the sun when moving from place to place, without the intricate sundials and standing stones. I can attest - sun still rises in the east, but it must have been with a lot less precision that they could predict the seasons changing.

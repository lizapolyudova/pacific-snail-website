title: Turning Point - an ode to Boston Visit

October 2022

```
The soap you have - the soap for now I use;
Each shower - warm embrace of normalcy, surrender
To scent of lavender (I wouldn't often choose)
Has now become a vessel to remember:

How do I rest?
Just idle, close my eyes towards the sun,
Lay on your shoulder, allow myself non-verbal thoughts,
Act more tired than I am - maybe this is calm,
I venture into nowhere (mostly populated) towards nothing
I find the stride to carry me with ease - 
Each time anew

The paths I take - some more familiar; all equally sunlit, 
All a reminder of the infatuation autumn places 
On an unexpecting heart

We sat - not oppose each other; close, just out of reach
Each in our respective couch, their backs against adjacent walls of corner of your living room.
The quiet could have swallowed setting sun 
My mind has already forgotten what I had been
Born after years of sleep, and I had now again become

In this new form - more cigarettes and drinking,
Also your every word

I learn things so banal like one can take the train quite simply - just by showing up; 
10 minutes - ticket and a track with boarding sign;
Then 40 minutes into blinding light,
Across the blurring colored forest.
Now in another town allow branching of a narrative cut short.
Laughing has been my rest from courage
And so "another time" becomes an inside joke

Three and a half days, enough to make my heart grow fonder
Squeezed in between cars rides, air travel, other lives 

An oceans breath, rage pouring, grasping every beauty 
Unnamed stone's layers holding up against the salt 
Tell me again of the adventures you will go on, 
I'll tell you of the things which stand still unresolved

How do I rage?
It starts with too-long of a silence. I never know which way my thought will turn 
Each sight a needle to the heart, each word an unexpected burn 
Blood becomes stone, then dust, then there is nothing left to feel
And so I wait for you to scrape and take my layered skin off peel by peel

How do I calm?
I'll tell you. Not by "breathing"
Anger does just not meditate away

Not by taking 20 painful minutes just to prove a point 
Not chanting half theatrically Into a bathroom mirror "I'm okay"

I watch the rain come down through a foggy window 
I sit alone, I smile, I stare 
I think of the adventures you will go on
I recognize (eventually with lightness) I'm not there
```

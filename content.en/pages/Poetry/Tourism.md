```
Exhausted tourists dragging their feet
Through the grand temple of not forgetting
Today I submit through and through 
Spending two continental breakfasts' worth 
On a glass of wine. To rest by a busy street 
But there is no rest amongst miniature castles 
Teenagers are not skating, no couches
are arranged across a west-facing pane
Ten people tall. This is not wandering.
I think back on the book of dreams 
Yesterday's conversations of sun temples 
Of... with the question posed 
"What is your objective?" Indeed
I saw a bus heading to Camden 
And missing the Irish way of speaking 
Always tugging on my own heart 
Strings all too well setup
Maybe to find a spot in the park and talk to a friend 
Maybe decide if what to make of this idea
Maybe admit that this passion too will be fleeting 
So tired of impermanence 
And the blistered feet which cannot carry on

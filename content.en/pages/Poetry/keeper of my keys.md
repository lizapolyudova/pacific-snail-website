```
My home, my heart, my love
The keeper of my soul and keys
To whom do I return when you no longer wish to carry
The weight I thought a gift

That leafy pet you keep that's tilting,
Reaching for the sun -
I turn; as though, when scarcity
Is evenly applied - can be undone.

And yearning will be tamed
And straighten out the pitiful
Barely year-old creature resembling bonsai

Not hardened by the will of wind or wire
Not tended to meticulously day after day
The vine persists demanding sun's desire
This time I will not turn  it, it will not suffice, I'll let it stay
```

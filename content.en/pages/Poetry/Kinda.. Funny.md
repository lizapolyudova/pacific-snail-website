```
I recorded almost perfect silence 
Playing back I could not hear it -
Defended by the soft clicking of the fridge 
```
---

```
I feel the blues 
Mosquitoes outside preventing me from walking 
All problems are too easy, yet too real
I hear that you get better at the things you practice 
I practice noting down misery and aimlessness 
So what?
```

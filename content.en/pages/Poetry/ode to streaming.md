```
I am away and nothing ties me 
my sense of self is - being entertained;
left without - I sink.
come back destroyed to that which is abandoned
come back to be a witness
to futility and overindulgence
no balance, no substance,
numbing day by day the truth that I exist
that I create by being
feedback loop of
misery and madness flows into
forgetful bliss and back
For how much longer
```

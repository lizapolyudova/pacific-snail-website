this is not a guide. This is a non-rhetorical question.

```
Where can I read poetry? Where do you find it?
Do you store leads and traces away any chance that you get
Awaiting for yourself to be ready
Now. Now I am ready to drink this holy water

But it is bitter. Sometimes insipid. Sometimes tasteless.
For thousand of times that I wish to be inspired 
I am left with light confusion and what I identify best as disappointment
But might be falsely set expectations

Who do you ask for poetry when you have none
Do you search "best poems of 2024" and wait for
Poetry pitchfork to deliver curated lists and prize-winners 
To astound you with oddly shaped senteces cut off 
In what I am sure is very intentional way

I go to open mic once a month. 
Sometimes it is enough, sometimes I don't make it.
Named but not remembered names and faces release words into the air
I don't get the cotemplative staring I was used to in my teens
Glaring at the page for sense to come streaming in
Making alive what I percieved dead on the page 
Wishing to play in my head back and forth and juggle with the context I carry and not
```

growth and development; no universal &ldquo;adult toolkit&rdquo; of skills. Missing &ldquo;essential competencies&rdquo; since they were assumed to be resolved by age and not effort -  [[concept of adulthood as competency]]
writing more letters to people, somehow I find just the writing process itself very soothing; it brings me joy to think about the fact that I am giving both myself and others a reason to put their thoughts on paper and send them off to be processed by someone else. Just like music is not meant to be constrained to rooms in which we tend top practice it alone, until perfection; speech should not necessarily wait to be perfected until it is shared.

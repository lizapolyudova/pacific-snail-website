The structure predates Stonehenge by approximately 2 thousand years and is located about 1 hour north of Dublin.\nAs a friend of mine put it\nwas it 3 people who were obsessed with stars? Were they the weird star geeks? Or was it the entire population. I like imagining a while population all evry organized diligently designing astrological ceremonial thing. But in reality most poeple were like \u0026ldquo;LETS BUILD HUGE STONE AND EARTH THING and then the 1-2% of autistic/nerdy people got obsessed with stars and tracking dates and the other people were like . ok ok that seems like a cool idea and not much extra work. we\u0026rsquo;ll turn the thing around to the point it in the direction you want\u0026rdquo;\nIndeed, one can learn much about the prehistoric society; there are countless books, there\u0026rsquo;s a categorization: Stone Age, Bronze Age, etc. Then each is further subdivided into eras with sufficiently distinct characteristics. Neolithic Age - the last part of Stone Age specifically differs from the one before it [Mesolithic] by introduction of agriculture, domestication of animals and a change from nomadic lifestyle to one that is settlement-base. All those should not come as a surprise - whether the knowledge is sources from middle school history books or games like civilization where skills are neatly laid out as a sequence to cross the Bronze Age threshold.\nYet, the question stands: we don\u0026rsquo;t truly understand that society.\nMy visit # I went to Newgrange on the day of the April New Moon in 2023. Took a bus in to Drogheda from Dublin the night before and stayed in a hostel. Was lucky to catch a wonderful couple spending their last evening of working at the hostel, moving on to continue traveling to County limerick near the Burren and Ailwee caves.\nI remember meeting some folks at the hostel the night before - it was their last day, sharing some shells I picked up on beaches in count Kerry, since they were heading there next and it seemed like a fun idea to ask them to return a shell to the beach.\nFirst thing on the next day I grabbed a taxi to the Newgrange visitor center, the appointment slot was at 9:30; there was morning traffic and people were getting to work - which seemed absurd in such proximity of a prehistoric site - life goes on.\nI stand in front of the visitor center, 930 deadline seems like a joke now, what is time. I remember a woman in front of me; a face shaped with kindness - her face almost always half-smiling, wrinkles carrying the memory of joyful times of the past, flowing gray hair. We probably chatted for a while, I ran into her and her family a few more times, each time with small talk getting no less small but somehow warming over time.\nNewgrange is place that affected me deeply when I went to see it. There are so many themes packed in here:\nchanging from nomadic people to agriculture-focused society tracking time with extreme precision without mathematics or a representative of reality astronomical model (really circling the word \u0026ldquo;wrong\u0026rdquo; here). I would really like to start exploring these themes in an essay, bullet points, or any other form, really. So far, I\u0026rsquo;ve mostly spent my time exploring this conversation through casual conversation with people who care to listen and engage.\nReading:\nMartin Brennan - Stones of Time Carrying stones # Pilgrimage of everyday things.\nI met a woman who told me she picks up stones on the side of the highway and bring them back home to create a pathway in her frontyard Newgrange is constructed specifically from stones which were brought over from \u0026gt;50 km away. Earlier that day, prior to hearing the story, I have given objects to new friends to be carried on a pilgrimage of their own. Who is to say whether they\u0026rsquo;ve completed the journey, but the natural inclination is what is interesting Then of course there is Ferdinand Cheval https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Cheval (who told me about him?! was it someone at newgrange? was it Brian? or Paul? who is to say) Some relevant snippets # I am thinking about newgrange again. The room I am staying in is an attic apartment. Bed next to a diagonal roof window facing almost directly east. I wake up around 5 each day from the sun (going back promptly to sleep of course). Until 10 or so the sun framed by the window travels across the room. I only have a few more days, but I think I\u0026rsquo;ll track how it progresses through the room, since I have my own personal. \u0026ldquo;roofbox\u0026rdquo;.\nMaybe building of the temple was partly a testament to end of the nomadic lifestyle. Neolithic period (last part of the stone age) is when people started changing from nomadic hunter-gatherers to an agriculture-focused society. I wonder how they tracked the sun when moving from place to place, without the intricate sundials and standing stones. I can attest - sun still rises in the east, but it must have been with a lot less precision that they could predict the seasons changing.\nRelevant pages here: roofbox model\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/pages/Astronomy-and-Archeoastronomy/archeoastronomy/","title":"Archeoastronomy","section":"Astronomy and Archeoastronomy","content":" resources # List of other resources University of Maryland Center for Archeoastronomy Clive Ruggles "},{"id":2,"href":"/pages/Astronomy-and-Archeoastronomy/section/","title":"Section","section":"Astronomy and Archeoastronomy","content":" Section # Section renders pages in section as definition list, using title and description.

I think I finally somewhat understand declinations of the moon. Declination in itself is a simple idea: it\u0026rsquo;s the vertical angle between the (line doing directly up? Idk the name) So sun declination through the year ranges from 23N to 23S\nMoon is more sporadic due to its angled orbit. There\u0026rsquo;s an 18 year cycle which changes max declination from to 28.smth\nThis is such a good explanation for moon standstills (kinda fully cuz some quotes are in all caps, but gotta appreciate their dedication to lack of other types of emphasis) Some outtakes:\nmoon does in a month what sun does in a year ( in terms of it\u0026rsquo;s movement in the sky) there is an 18 year long cycle in which the \u0026ldquo;amplitude\u0026rdquo; moon monthly declination fluctuates (so 9 years between major and minor lunar standstill. Pictured above) https://www.umass.edu/sunwheel/pages/moonteaching.html\nSpecifically. You can think of it as: on years when we are close to a minor lunar standstill. No matter how hard the moon tries, it will always be kinda barely rolling along the horizon. Whereas on major standstill years each month the moon will have low and high days. Some higher than the sun could ever reach. Not trying to be dramatic, it just kinda comes out that way. I think we are close to a major standstill next year\nreferences # http://www.bajr.org/BAJRread/BAJRGuides.asp# (specifically [[archeoastronomy]] guide ) https://www.umass.edu/sunwheel/pages/moonteaching.html recommended reading # Ruggles, C.

Funny I thought - solstice is not for another few weeks - which I promptly pointed out to her. Turns out those are distinct phenomena.\nThe day after we meet at a cafe. Both intending to be there at 530 and both arriving an hour early to get some quiet time. Have I had the chance to figure out why it is that the sunset happens before the solstice? Not yet. We attempt and earth model with a yarn - it is entirely insufficient. I place my hypotheses:\nquestions # earliest sunrise then must happen before the summer solstice is it the case that latest sunrise would happen on the day of the solstice and starting from that, the day would start to increase? is the difference due to the elliptic orbit of the earth which has its longer radius that does not exactly match the \u0026ldquo;peak\u0026rdquo; position at the solstices? almost none are correct as it turns out We start plotting.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a sin wave for the sunrise. Starting at the fall equinox. going up (hours on the day) towards winter solstice and falling back down through \u0026ldquo;zero\u0026rdquo; towards summer solstice for its earliest (or so I think at the time) - point. Let\u0026rsquo;s call this one point of reference\n$$A_r * -sin(t) $$\nThen there\u0026rsquo;s the sunset line. Going the opposite way; as we know - a bit offset.\n$$A_s * sin(t+ \\theta)$$\nwith theta representing the radial offset with 2pi representing the full year. A_s and A_r represent the amplitude of the waves.. in the case that they are not identical\u0026hellip;\nFor all we know, this is not quite correct, either. in my mind I am thinking - I should be thinking of the elliptic orbit as a parametric equation and using that, since that\u0026rsquo;s my hypothesis.\nAlright then. // include plots as well\u0026hellip; so the function of our day length would be $$Base_s + A_s * sin(t + \\theta) - (Base_r - A_r * sin(t))$$$${Base_s-Base_r} + A_s * sin(t)cos(\\theta) + A_scos(t)sin(\\theta)+A_rsin(t)$$ $$LengthOfay = sin(t) * (A_s * cos(\\theta) + A_r) + A_s*cos(t) + const$$\nok I want to find min and max values of this function (or rather, the t values at which they occur). I am pretty sure to do that I\u0026rsquo;d want the derivative to be 0. Keep in mind that cos(\\theta) is a constant\ncos(t)*(A_s*cos(\\theta) + A_r) - A_s*sin(t) = 0 sin(t)/cos(t) = (A_s*cos(\\theta)+ A_r)/A_s needless to say, I don\u0026rsquo;t get very far with my math. And, as it turns out - a lot of my initial assumption are wrong. However! We did find answers to our initial hypothesis even with the limited data and slightly generalized premises.\nThe converse of the statement \u0026ldquo;earliest sunset happens before the winter solstice\u0026rdquo; is in fact \u0026ldquo;latest sunset happens before the summer solstice\u0026rdquo; - rather than anything about sunrises, as their period is identical. Latest sunrise does not in fact happen on the day of the solstice. Rather, it happens about the same time after the solstice as the sunset extrema happens before. This got me thinking about matching rates of changes on the curves of the sunset/sunrise curves and whether their amplitudes might be different. follow-up # I got home and after some existential struggles I am currently going through (unfulfilling job etc) I decided to return to my question. I stumbled upon this reddit thread in which the first commented also hypothesized about the elliptic nature of the orbit. However, could not justify their reasoning. The second one however links to something interesting called annalema which refers to the north-south rather than east-west tilt of the earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis. This seems much more in line with why sunset and sunrise times would be different.\nThe exact dates are those [earliest/latest sunrise/sunset] on which the Sun is at the points where the horizon is tangential to the analemma, which in turn depend on how much the analemma, or the north–south meridian passing through it, is tilted from the vertical.\nfact checking # [[sunset and sunrise plots]] is a related idea I had about expressing intuition in a graphic. Which apparently is non-trivial given that there\u0026rsquo;s a whole wikipedia page on the \u0026ldquo;sunrise equation\u0026rdquo;\nIn addition to that - next thing I am learning that even my hypothesis about sunset/sunrise being sin waves is almost entirely wrong. Taking a look at the solartopo[3] link at something closer to the equator, the sunrise/sunset times more closely resemble a sum of multiple curves? I\u0026rsquo;d love to try and deconstruct it\u0026hellip;\nlinks # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise_equation http://www.solartopo.com/daylength-course-of-the-year.htm "}]

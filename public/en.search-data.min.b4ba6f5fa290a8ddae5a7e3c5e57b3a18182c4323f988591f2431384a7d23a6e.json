The structure predates Stonehenge by approximately 2 thousand years and is located about 1 hour north of Dublin.\nAs a friend of mine put it\nwas it 3 people who were obsessed with stars? Were they the weird star geeks? Or was it the entire population. I like imagining a while population all evry organized diligently designing astrological ceremonial thing. But in reality most poeple were like \u0026ldquo;LETS BUILD HUGE STONE AND EARTH THING and then the 1-2% of autistic/nerdy people got obsessed with stars and tracking dates and the other people were like . ok ok that seems like a cool idea and not much extra work. we\u0026rsquo;ll turn the thing around to the point it in the direction you want\u0026rdquo;\nIndeed, one can learn much about the prehistoric society; there are countless books, there\u0026rsquo;s a categorization: Stone Age, Bronze Age, etc. Then each is further subdivided into eras with sufficiently distinct characteristics. Neolithic Age - the last part of Stone Age specifically differs from the one before it [Mesolithic] by introduction of agriculture, domestication of animals and a change from nomadic lifestyle to one that is settlement-base. All those should not come as a surprise - whether the knowledge is sources from middle school history books or games like civilization where skills are neatly laid out as a sequence to cross the Bronze Age threshold.\nYet, the question stands: we don\u0026rsquo;t truly understand that society.\nMy visit # I went to Newgrange on the day of the April New Moon in 2023. Took a bus in to Drogheda from Dublin the night before and stayed in a hostel. Was lucky to catch a wonderful couple spending their last evening of working at the hostel, moving on to continue traveling to County limerick near the Burren and Ailwee caves.\nI remember meeting some folks at the hostel the night before - it was their last day, sharing some shells I picked up on beaches in count Kerry, since they were heading there next and it seemed like a fun idea to ask them to return a shell to the beach.\nFirst thing on the next day I grabbed a taxi to the Newgrange visitor center, the appointment slot was at 9:30; there was morning traffic and people were getting to work - which seemed absurd in such proximity of a prehistoric site - life goes on.\nI stand in front of the visitor center, 930 deadline seems like a joke now, what is time. I remember a woman in front of me; a face shaped with kindness - her face almost always half-smiling, wrinkles carrying the memory of joyful times of the past, flowing gray hair. We probably chatted for a while, I ran into her and her family a few more times, each time with small talk getting no less small but somehow warming over time.\nNewgrange is place that affected me deeply when I went to see it. There are so many themes packed in here:\nchanging from nomadic people to agriculture-focused society tracking time with extreme precision without mathematics or a representative of reality astronomical model (really circling the word \u0026ldquo;wrong\u0026rdquo; here). I would really like to start exploring these themes in an essay, bullet points, or any other form, really. So far, I\u0026rsquo;ve mostly spent my time exploring this conversation through casual conversation with people who care to listen and engage.\nReading:\nMartin Brennan - Stones of Time Carrying stones # Pilgrimage of everyday things.\nI met a woman who told me she picks up stones on the side of the highway and bring them back home to create a pathway in her frontyard Newgrange is constructed specifically from stones which were brought over from \u0026gt;50 km away. Earlier that day, prior to hearing the story, I have given objects to new friends to be carried on a pilgrimage of their own. Who is to say whether they\u0026rsquo;ve completed the journey, but the natural inclination is what is interesting Then of course there is Ferdinand Cheval https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Cheval (who told me about him?! was it someone at newgrange? was it Brian? or Paul? who is to say) Some relevant snippets # I am thinking about newgrange again. The room I am staying in is an attic apartment. Bed next to a diagonal roof window facing almost directly east. I wake up around 5 each day from the sun (going back promptly to sleep of course). Until 10 or so the sun framed by the window travels across the room. I only have a few more days, but I think I\u0026rsquo;ll track how it progresses through the room, since I have my own personal. \u0026ldquo;roofbox\u0026rdquo;.\nMaybe building of the temple was partly a testament to end of the nomadic lifestyle. Neolithic period (last part of the stone age) is when people started changing from nomadic hunter-gatherers to an agriculture-focused society. I wonder how they tracked the sun when moving from place to place, without the intricate sundials and standing stones. I can attest - sun still rises in the east, but it must have been with a lot less precision that they could predict the seasons changing.\nRelevant pages here: roofbox model\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/pages/Astronomy-and-Archeoastronomy/archeoastronomy/","title":"Archeoastronomy","section":"Astronomy and Archeoastronomy","content":" resources # List of other resources University of Maryland Center for Archeoastronomy Clive Ruggles "},{"id":4,"href":"/pages/Astronomy-and-Archeoastronomy/section/","title":"Section","section":"Astronomy and Archeoastronomy","content":" Section # Section renders pages in section as definition list, using title and description.

I found it kind of funny to start out with \u0026ldquo;yeaaa women in charge!

One of the pieces is an interactive piece with audiotape glued on a canvas arranged as a narrative you can navigate by rolling the tapehead. for choices instructions are given in \u0026ldquo;turn n degrees\u0026rdquo; at crossroads. Such a cool concept.\nAs the party is growing, a beautiful gameplay mechanic is introduced in which you play different characters of the party. Sometimes the transition is obvious; other times - less so.\nA favorite scene of mine (I think sometime in act 2) is Shannon and Conway are heading out from the museum after having met Ezra. You can walk around as Conway with his broken leg but once outside a certain range - you seamlessly switch to Ezra, who is initially doing erratic circles around Conway. I found the moment confusing. I went back to find the exact radius, to deconstruct - that\u0026rsquo;s how I often treat magical experiences.\nThen there\u0026rsquo;s the gold skeletons. Like any symbolism introduced early and explored deeper as you get into it, the intrigue, the guessing helps you form your own theories before you are offered an explanation.\nSomething this game seems to me is a meditation on, a reminder of agency of thought. Sometime in act 3 (I think scene 12) when Shannon and Conway recall exploring where the \u0026ldquo;strangers\u0026rdquo; come from, the guide of the distillery is showing Conway the truck. You are inspecting various parts of the truck. There are two options - to comment on the physical property, or the option in italics which immerses you in a memory, ignoring completely the ongoing surface-level conversation, treating speech as irrelevant and inner monologue as essential and worth tending to.\nIt is not infrequent that the game gives you the choice to not listen, to notice, to think about something seemingly tangential. It is interesting that little of the narrative changes depending on which conversation options you as the player are choosing. Rather, you are allowing the characters to feel in different ways - they are the ones you speak for.\nThe outcome of the story fatefully cannot be modified. What can be changed is how you as the player experience the reality, the reality you talk about offscreen which is only true in words and yet somehow solidified. There\u0026rsquo;s also the elusive nature of things unsaid - you rarely get to circle back and often times options for dialogue provided are mutually exclusive, non-sequitur which will never allow the conversation to circle back to the same place.\nI think this game makes me understand role-playing games. When a boat floats by in the foreground with musicians and a bluesy tune plays. How can I - the character at the top of the stairs casually descend down and rush over to my boat instead of listening? When given the option to leave or \u0026ldquo;stick around for a while\u0026rdquo; - I\u0026rsquo;ll pick that sometimes. That\u0026rsquo;s what life feels like at times, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to leave places behind, to know just when it is time to go.\nThe first first character you are playing by middle of act 4 is gone. The reason you\u0026rsquo;ve started your quest has disappeared - captured by the distillery, drowned by his inevitable debt. The scene accompanying the departure appropriately talks about loss, how people do strange things when they miss someone. I miss him, I wonder whether he is all-right.\nreturning to act 5 # After a long break (I was away in NYC, waiting for my Canadian immigration paperwork to go though) I have returned to Montreal; it feels like the right time to finish the game.\nAct 5 is about the choice to rebuild a city which was built among burial mounds. Choice to stay behind for no reason other than chance and being in good company. How appropriate. I am glad I saved it until now. I am really only here because of chance and good company, on a hunch.

The tone established by the first episodes makes the narrative line not quite clear, but clearly communicates the intention of a well-researched piece which will be rich with personal accounts and the narrator\u0026rsquo;s introspective sidenotes.\nThe podcast focuses on the aftermath of the BP oil spill 13 years after the incident. First taking a closer look at the incident itself, breaking down how the media narrative was controlled, then diving more deeply not just into environmental repercussions, but long term health effects of the people involved in the cleanup, giving equal attention to legal and medical details of their cases.\nIn terms of tone, the piece really allows to dive into investigative journalism as a story which develops and takes a life of its own, rather than one that is pre-destined in the eye of the future producer. The final cut includes brainstorming sessions between the two lead reporters talking about not being able to obtain evidence and strategizing how they are going to progress the story, which narrative branch to pursue, the main narrator frequently talks about his process of traveling to someone\u0026rsquo;s house, how it is on the way to someone else\u0026rsquo;s, making connections of people we\u0026rsquo;ve already met, people we\u0026rsquo;ve already heard mentioned. It creates a beautifully dense fabric of connections and people who all seem to be experiencing the event together apart. It also gives a very believable imitation of investigating - to be taken on someone else\u0026rsquo;s journey of deciding which way to go. be faced with lack of information, be faced with closed door and people who will not talk to you for one reason or another.\nIn terms of the content - it was both heartwarming and disheartening. Best stories feel like tapestries - the larger motif revealing itself as you step away and the intricate complexity of each individual story drawing you in as you get close. There are many wonderful personal account of what feels like all possible stages of a journey in this disaster. Fishermen talking about their connection to sea filled with sentiment and yet maintaining their southern masculinity, men and women talking about seeing their loved ones fall sick and die, personal accounts of being sick, the disorientation of it, the extent of lack of information that is shared, many public meetings held with enraged southererns demanding their justice.\nDisheartening\u0026hellip; let\u0026rsquo;s talk about that part. The zoomed out picture is unfortunately so depressing the most depressing part about it is how unsurprising it is - BP\u0026rsquo;s conduct and handling on the situation. Not only have they lied and not shared sufficient information during the initial incident, but they have systematically suppressed data in the process of the cleanup and refused to both protected people from the known harm as well as compensate them for the after-effects of the toxic chemicals.\nTerrifying is the amount of power they wield. The level of obscurity a large company is able to introduce into the process in which they control most of the data and the blatant disregard for human lives involved; not by humans within the company necessarily (as there was evidence of safety hazards being raised internally), but by the \u0026ldquo;corporate entity\u0026rdquo; as a whole which seems to have few wishes other than to continue its own existence at the expense of others, willing to put on the line anything it deems necessary.\n"},{"id":18,"href":"/pages/Astronomy-and-Archeoastronomy/earliest-and-latest-sunsets-sunrises-and-solstice/","title":"solstice and surrounding events","section":"Astronomy and Archeoastronomy","content":" preface # Emily texted me a few days ago: it\u0026rsquo;s the earliest sunset of the year today! Funny I thought - solstice is not for another few weeks - which I promptly pointed out to her. Turns out those are distinct phenomena.\nThe day after we meet at a cafe. Both intending to be there at 530 and both arriving an hour early to get some quiet time. Have I had the chance to figure out why it is that the sunset happens before the solstice? Not yet. We attempt and earth model with a yarn - it is entirely insufficient. I place my hypotheses:\nquestions # earliest sunrise then must happen before the summer solstice is it the case that latest sunrise would happen on the day of the solstice and starting from that, the day would start to increase? is the difference due to the elliptic orbit of the earth which has its longer radius that does not exactly match the \u0026ldquo;peak\u0026rdquo; position at the solstices? almost none are correct as it turns out We start plotting.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a sin wave for the sunrise. Starting at the fall equinox. going up (hours on the day) towards winter solstice and falling back down through \u0026ldquo;zero\u0026rdquo; towards summer solstice for its earliest (or so I think at the time) - point. Let\u0026rsquo;s call this one point of reference\n$$A_r * -sin(t) $$\nThen there\u0026rsquo;s the sunset line. Going the opposite way; as we know - a bit offset.\n$$A_s * sin(t+ \\theta)$$\nwith theta representing the radial offset with 2pi representing the full year. $A_s$ and $A_r$ represent the amplitude of the waves.. in the case that they are not identical\u0026hellip;\nFor all we know, this is not quite correct, either. in my mind I am thinking - I should be thinking of the elliptic orbit as a parametric equation and using that, since that\u0026rsquo;s my hypothesis.\nAlright then. // include plots as well\u0026hellip; so the function of our day length would be $$Base_s + A_s \\cdot sin(t + \\theta) - (Base_r - A_r \\cdot sin(t))$$$${Base_s-Base_r} + A_s \\cdot sin(t) \\cdot cos(\\theta) + A_{s*cos(t)}\\cdot sin(\\theta)+A_{r}\\cdot sin(t)$$ $$LengthOfDay = sin(t) * (A_s \\cdot cos(\\theta) + A_r) + A_{s}\\cdot cos(t) + const$$\nok I want to find min and max values of this function (or rather, the t values at which they occur). I am pretty sure to do that I\u0026rsquo;d want the derivative to be 0. Keep in mind that cos(\\theta) is a constant\n$$cos(t)\\cdot(A_{s\\cdot}cos(\\theta) + A_r) - A_{s\\cdot}sin(t) = 0$$ $$\\frac{sin(t)}{cos(t)} = \\frac{A_{s\\cdot}cos(\\theta)+ A_r}{A_s}$$\nneedless to say, I don\u0026rsquo;t get very far with my math. And, as it turns out - a lot of my initial assumption are wrong. However! We did find answers to our initial hypothesis even with the limited data and slightly generalized premises.\nThe converse of the statement \u0026ldquo;earliest sunset happens before the winter solstice\u0026rdquo; is in fact \u0026ldquo;latest sunset happens before the summer solstice\u0026rdquo; - rather than anything about sunrises, as their period is identical. Latest sunrise does not in fact happen on the day of the solstice. Rather, it happens about the same time after the solstice as the sunset extrema happens before. This got me thinking about matching rates of changes on the curves of the sunset/sunrise curves and whether their amplitudes might be different. follow-up # I got home and after some existential struggles I am currently going through (unfulfilling job etc) I decided to return to my question. I stumbled upon this reddit thread in which the first commented also hypothesized about the elliptic nature of the orbit. However, could not justify their reasoning. The second one however links to something interesting called annalema which refers to the north-south rather than east-west tilt of the earth\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis. This seems much more in line with why sunset and sunrise times would be different.\nThe exact dates are those [earliest/latest sunrise/sunset] on which the Sun is at the points where the horizon is tangential to the analemma, which in turn depend on how much the analemma, or the north–south meridian passing through it, is tilted from the vertical.\nfact checking # [[sunset and sunrise plots]] is a related idea I had about expressing intuition in a graphic. Which apparently is non-trivial given that there\u0026rsquo;s a whole wikipedia page on the \u0026ldquo;sunrise equation\u0026rdquo;\nIn addition to that - next thing I am learning that even my hypothesis about sunset/sunrise being sin waves is almost entirely wrong. Taking a look at the solartopo[3] link at something closer to the equator, the sunrise/sunset times more closely resemble a sum of multiple curves? I\u0026rsquo;d love to try and deconstruct it\u0026hellip;\nlinks # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise_equation http://www.solartopo.com/daylength-course-of-the-year.htm "},{"id":19,"href":"/pages/Reviews/The-mushroom-at-the-end-of-the-world/","title":"The mushroom at the end of the world","section":"Reviews","content":"Date: October 2022\nHalfway through the book, I felt elated by the\n"}]

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;https://poetryinphysics.wordpress.com/2016/11/09/a-physicist-responds-to-the-three-body-problem/&#34;&gt;https://poetryinphysics.wordpress.com/2016/11/09/a-physicist-responds-to-the-three-body-problem/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ok the book really picked up in the last 3rd, I was totally wrong. Now I&amp;rsquo;ll have to finish the trilogy! They still have a few hundred years to go until they encounter the aliens.&#xA;I was thinking more about scifi vs fantasy and I think they are pretty similar! Except scifi aesthetics sometimes make dreaming concepts very fun. It reminds me of getting high and doing my math homework. All those multidimensional structures coming into place, ready for me to think about them as I&amp;rsquo;m going to sleep.&#xA;A core concept later in the book is making a computer out of a single proton. I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you about it next time. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult for me to comment on feasibility but it sure is fun to think about.&#xA;I guess scifi has a lot of lore built-in which comes from high school/early college science classes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We don’t passively forget that something is scary. We actively learn that it isn’t anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Studies like these clarify that the amygdala isn’t about the pleasure of experiencing pleasure. It’s about the uncertain, unsettled yearning for a potential pleasure, the anxiety and fear and anger that the reward may be smaller than anticipated, or may not even happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;&#xA;  notes&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#notes&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;testosterone&#34;&gt;&#xA;  testosterone&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#testosterone&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Makes one more likely in a way which would maintain a social status. Counter to popular belief, does not increase aggression per se, but makes already aggressive individuals more so&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Having a single idea/character to impersonate seems like a strategy of unification. Reminds me of:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Descriptions of the language are beautiful and haunting. Specifically, language reminds of it&amp;rsquo;s existence with first encounter with a human - escaped prisoner from the crushed shuttle. The spiders comment on the inefficiency of speaking from the same opening that is used for eating (funny). The language also comes through in their understanding of the world - the universal web to refer to what humans in early 20th century would have thought of as the ether.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started playing on Paul&amp;rsquo;s recommendation.. avoiding thinking about some things (flagpoling, starting job soon, procrastinating on responding to emails to Paul and Alli)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So far it&amp;rsquo;s very surreal (in act 2 so far)&#xA;The interlude between act 1 and 2 included a gallery showing and 3 people interacting with it. One of the pieces is an interactive piece with audiotape glued on a canvas arranged as a narrative you can navigate by rolling the tapehead. for choices instructions are given in &amp;ldquo;turn n degrees&amp;rdquo; at crossroads. Such a cool concept.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;August 2023 - Montreal, QC&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stories pinch me with their humanity like few other things do, maybe in the way I used to feel watching movies when I was younger. Everything feels too true, too simple, without a moralistic tale tacked on or purposefully embedded. In its simplicity - tears feel true, I have no inclination to disbelief and that honestly is disarming and beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reading this on a recommendation from a friend (Sheridan), accidentally picked this up at a bookstore in Mile End, did not expect to see it anywhere really.&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I had many expectations going in; in fact, I feel as though I am not sure what I am in the mood to read - often a good state to read short stories in.&#xA;The prologue influenced me to an extent, set the tone to pay attention to the humor, the tone, the details and the observational eye brought forth by the narrator. The introduction also discloses that much of the work is auto-fiction (meaning, largely auto-biographical, but set to be fiction).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;#podast #investigative&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Podcast by American western media&amp;rsquo;s &#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;https://laist.com/people/dan-leone&#34;&gt;Dan Leone&lt;/a&gt; and is an excellent piece of investigative journalism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I listened to the flow series (of 8 episodes, about 40 minute each) in what feels like one breath and more realistically was 3 long dark winter evenings.&#xA;The tone established by the first episodes makes the narrative line not quite clear, but clearly communicates the intention of a well-researched piece which will be rich with personal accounts and the narrator&amp;rsquo;s introspective sidenotes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;12-episode scifi/fantasy series focusing largely on biodiversity of an alien planet with many elaborate visuals featuring circle-of-life type mini-stories.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some themes that spoke to me:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Levi&amp;rsquo;s character arc. I was going to say &amp;ldquo;transformation&amp;rdquo;, but who are we to say how much they actually transformed; rather, their character is revealed through the series. First time they lead Azi into a beautiful oasis as a refuge from the storm, Levi points out structures they&amp;rsquo;ve made. Levi is making art - because it feels necessary. I loved that&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Creatures are not inherently evil; they are largely just trying to survive. Someone pointed out that the series opens with Sam cutting guts from a monster which we later see decomposing a few episode later. In the end - Sam dies consumed by a parasite for their own needs. Who is evil really? They are all just trying to survive in the best way they know how to, with tools available to them. Some creatures are hostile and dangerous to others, all are&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

Stories pinch me with their humanity like few other things do, maybe in the way I used to feel watching movies when I was younger. Everything feels too true, too simple, without a moralistic tale tacked on or purposefully embedded. In its simplicity - tears feel true, I have no inclination to disbelief and that honestly is disarming and beautiful.

Reading this on a recommendation from a friend (Sheridan), accidentally picked this up at a bookstore in Mile End, did not expect to see it anywhere really.
I don&rsquo;t think I had many expectations going in; in fact, I feel as though I am not sure what I am in the mood to read - often a good state to read short stories in.
The prologue influenced me to an extent, set the tone to pay attention to the humor, the tone, the details and the observational eye brought forth by the narrator. The introduction also discloses that much of the work is auto-fiction (meaning, largely auto-biographical, but set to be fiction).">

<p>Reading this on a recommendation from a friend (Sheridan), accidentally picked this up at a bookstore in Mile End, did not expect to see it anywhere really.
I don&rsquo;t think I had many expectations going in; in fact, I feel as though I am not sure what I am in the mood to read - often a good state to read short stories in.
The prologue influenced me to an extent, set the tone to pay attention to the humor, the tone, the details and the observational eye brought forth by the narrator. The introduction also discloses that much of the work is auto-fiction (meaning, largely auto-biographical, but set to be fiction).</p>
<p>A lot of the subject matter is her own life - dealing with alcoholism, men in her life, relationships with her sister, abuse from parents. I cannot quite figure out whether the punk lifestyle is something she glamorizes, there are certainly points at which the lifestyle is romanticized - sleeping on roofs, the freedom of all of it.</p>

<p>a sense of recognizing after many years, the youthful love which comes without romance or sexual desire, just a being together and a sense of shared mystery, the oh-so-unlikely kind of knowing that includes counting birthmarks on another&rsquo;s back. I like the inter-leaving of this story, how certain the protagonist is of meeting this childhood friend, how not for a second she doubts her instinct.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I asked him what he thought it was like. He held his hand up to mine so our fingers were all touching, had me run my thumb and forefinger over our touching ones. You can&rsquo;t tell which is which. Must be something like that he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="toda-luna-todo-año">
  toda luna, todo año
  <a class="anchor" href="#toda-luna-todo-a%c3%b1o">#</a>
</h3>
<p>opens with a scene of translating poetry, astutely accurate (or at least seems to be) in its search for words.</p>
<p>story about going on vacation and instead staying in a house outside the resort with fisherman and a diver who she has a brief affair with.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and that&rsquo;s it, she thought later, at the breakfast table. The acceptance she felt from them wasn&rsquo;t because they liked her or because she fit in. She has simply shorn up, like the young man, who had since disappeared. Maybe it was because the divers were so much underwater, among such vastness. Anything was expected, of equal unimportance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is some comfort in the way she described being accepted of this specific variety, a sense of being accepted because nothing is truly out of place. It is a nice feeling to remember, to have the permission to exist, give yourself that permission.</p>
<h3 id="wait-a-minute">

  <a class="anchor" href="#wait-a-minute">#</a>
</h3>
<p>beautiful story of parting with her sister, talking about death and about loss.
I liked this quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I used to think it was funny when someone said, &ldquo;I lost my husband.&rdquo; But that is how it feels. Someone is missing.</p>
</blockquote>

Such a cool concept.\nAs the party is growing, a beautiful gameplay mechanic is introduced in which you play different characters of the party. Sometimes the transition is obvious; other times - less so.\nA favorite scene of mine (I think sometime in act 2) is Shannon and Conway are heading out from the museum after having met Ezra. You can walk around as Conway with his broken leg but once outside a certain range - you seamlessly switch to Ezra, who is initially doing erratic circles around Conway. I found the moment confusing. I went back to find the exact radius, to deconstruct - that\u0026rsquo;s how I often treat magical experiences.\nThen there\u0026rsquo;s the gold skeletons. Like any symbolism introduced early and explored deeper as you get into it, the intrigue, the guessing helps you form your own theories before you are offered an explanation.\nSomething this game seems to me is a meditation on, a reminder of agency of thought. Sometime in act 3 (I think scene 12) when Shannon and Conway recall exploring where the \u0026ldquo;strangers\u0026rdquo; come from, the guide of the distillery is showing Conway the truck. You are inspecting various parts of the truck. There are two options - to comment on the physical property, or the option in italics which immerses you in a memory, ignoring completely the ongoing surface-level conversation, treating speech as irrelevant and inner monologue as essential and worth tending to.\nIt is not infrequent that the game gives you the choice to not listen, to notice, to think about something seemingly tangential. It is interesting that little of the narrative changes depending on which conversation options you as the player are choosing. Rather, you are allowing the characters to feel in different ways - they are the ones you speak for.\nThe outcome of the story fatefully cannot be modified. What can be changed is how you as the player experience the reality, the reality you talk about offscreen which is only true in words and yet somehow solidified. There\u0026rsquo;s also the elusive nature of things unsaid - you rarely get to circle back and often times options for dialogue provided are mutually exclusive, non-sequitur which will never allow the conversation to circle back to the same place.\nI think this game makes me understand role-playing games. When a boat floats by in the foreground with musicians and a bluesy tune plays. How can I - the character at the top of the stairs casually descend down and rush over to my boat instead of listening? When given the option to leave or \u0026ldquo;stick around for a while\u0026rdquo; - I\u0026rsquo;ll pick that sometimes. That\u0026rsquo;s what life feels like at times, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to leave places behind, to know just when it is time to go.\nThe first first character you are playing by middle of act 4 is gone. The reason you\u0026rsquo;ve started your quest has disappeared - captured by the distillery, drowned by his inevitable debt. The scene accompanying the departure appropriately talks about loss, how people do strange things when they miss someone. I miss him, I wonder whether he is all-right.\nreturning to act 5 # After a long break (I was away in NYC, waiting for my Canadian immigration paperwork to go though) I have returned to Montreal; it feels like the right time to finish the game.\nAct 5 is about the choice to rebuild a city which was built among burial mounds. Choice to stay behind for no reason other than chance and being in good company. How appropriate. I am glad I saved it until now. I am really only here because of chance and good company, on a hunch. Hunting something elusive; an inspiration, a feeling once had.

Sometimes the transition is obvious; other times - less so.\nA favorite scene of mine (I think sometime in act 2) is Shannon and Conway are heading out from the museum after having met Ezra. You can walk around as Conway with his broken leg but once outside a certain range - you seamlessly switch to Ezra, who is initially doing erratic circles around Conway. I found the moment confusing. I went back to find the exact radius, to deconstruct - that\u0026rsquo;s how I often treat magical experiences.\nThen there\u0026rsquo;s the gold skeletons. Like any symbolism introduced early and explored deeper as you get into it, the intrigue, the guessing helps you form your own theories before you are offered an explanation.\nSomething this game seems to me is a meditation on, a reminder of agency of thought. Sometime in act 3 (I think scene 12) when Shannon and Conway recall exploring where the \u0026ldquo;strangers\u0026rdquo; come from, the guide of the distillery is showing Conway the truck. You are inspecting various parts of the truck. There are two options - to comment on the physical property, or the option in italics which immerses you in a memory, ignoring completely the ongoing surface-level conversation, treating speech as irrelevant and inner monologue as essential and worth tending to.\nIt is not infrequent that the game gives you the choice to not listen, to notice, to think about something seemingly tangential. It is interesting that little of the narrative changes depending on which conversation options you as the player are choosing. Rather, you are allowing the characters to feel in different ways - they are the ones you speak for.\nThe outcome of the story fatefully cannot be modified. What can be changed is how you as the player experience the reality, the reality you talk about offscreen which is only true in words and yet somehow solidified. There\u0026rsquo;s also the elusive nature of things unsaid - you rarely get to circle back and often times options for dialogue provided are mutually exclusive, non-sequitur which will never allow the conversation to circle back to the same place.\nI think this game makes me understand role-playing games. When a boat floats by in the foreground with musicians and a bluesy tune plays. How can I - the character at the top of the stairs casually descend down and rush over to my boat instead of listening? When given the option to leave or \u0026ldquo;stick around for a while\u0026rdquo; - I\u0026rsquo;ll pick that sometimes. That\u0026rsquo;s what life feels like at times, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to leave places behind, to know just when it is time to go.\nThe first first character you are playing by middle of act 4 is gone. The reason you\u0026rsquo;ve started your quest has disappeared - captured by the distillery, drowned by his inevitable debt. The scene accompanying the departure appropriately talks about loss, how people do strange things when they miss someone. I miss him, I wonder whether he is all-right.\nreturning to act 5 # After a long break (I was away in NYC, waiting for my Canadian immigration paperwork to go though) I have returned to Montreal; it feels like the right time to finish the game.\nAct 5 is about the choice to rebuild a city which was built among burial mounds. Choice to stay behind for no reason other than chance and being in good company. How appropriate. I am glad I saved it until now. I am really only here because of chance and good company, on a hunch. Hunting something elusive; an inspiration, a feeling once had.

Funny I thought - solstice is not for another few weeks - which I promptly pointed out to her. Turns out those are distinct phenomena.\nThe day after we meet at a cafe. Both intending to be there at 530 and both arriving an hour early to get some quiet time. Have I had the chance to figure out why it is that the sunset happens before the solstice? Not yet. We attempt and earth model with a yarn - it is entirely insufficient. I place my hypotheses:\nquestions # earliest sunrise then must happen before the summer solstice is it the case that latest sunrise would happen on the day of the solstice and starting from that, the day would start to increase? is the difference due to the elliptic orbit of the earth which has its longer radius that does not exactly match the \u0026ldquo;peak\u0026rdquo; position at the solstices? almost none are correct as it turns out We start plotting.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a sin wave for the sunrise. Starting at the fall equinox. going up (hours on the day) towards winter solstice and falling back down through \u0026ldquo;zero\u0026rdquo; towards summer solstice for its earliest (or so I think at the time) - point. Let\u0026rsquo;s call this one point of reference\n$$A_r \\cdot -sin(t) $$\nThen there\u0026rsquo;s the sunset line. Going the opposite way; as we know - a bit offset.\n$$A_s \\cdot sin(t+ \\theta)$$\nwith theta representing the radial offset with 2pi representing the full year. $A_s$ and $A_r$ represent the amplitude of the waves.. in the case that they are not identical\u0026hellip;\nFor all we know, this is not quite correct, either. in my mind I am thinking - I should be thinking of the elliptic orbit as a parametric equation and using that, since that\u0026rsquo;s my hypothesis.\nAlright then. // include plots as well\u0026hellip; so the function of our day length would be $$Base_s + A_s \\cdot sin(t + \\theta) - (Base_r - A_r \\cdot sin(t))$$$${Base_s-Base_r} + A_s \\cdot sin(t) \\cdot cos(\\theta) + A_{s*cos(t)}\\cdot sin(\\theta)+A_{r}\\cdot sin(t)$$ $$LengthOfDay = sin(t) * (A_s \\cdot cos(\\theta) + A_r) + A_{s}\\cdot cos(t) + const$$\nok I want to find min and max values of this function (or rather, the t values at which they occur). I am pretty sure to do that I\u0026rsquo;d want the derivative to be 0. Keep in mind that cos(\\theta) is a constant\n$$cos(t)\\cdot(A_{s\\cdot}cos(\\theta) + A_r) - A_{s\\cdot}sin(t) = 0$$ $$\\frac{sin(t)}{cos(t)} = \\frac{A_{s\\cdot}cos(\\theta)+ A_r}{A_s}$$\nneedless to say, I don\u0026rsquo;t get very far with my math. And, as it turns out - a lot of my initial assumption are wrong. However! We did find answers to our initial hypothesis even with the limited data and slightly generalized premises.\nThe converse of the statement \u0026ldquo;earliest sunset happens before the winter solstice\u0026rdquo; is in fact \u0026ldquo;latest sunset happens before the summer solstice\u0026rdquo; - rather than anything about sunrises, as their period is identical. Latest sunrise does not in fact happen on the day of the solstice. Rather, it happens about the same time after the solstice as the sunset extrema happens before. This got me thinking about matching rates of changes on the curves of the sunset/sunrise curves and whether their amplitudes might be different. follow-up # I got home and after some existential struggles I am currently going through (unfulfilling job etc) I decided to return to my question.

Funny I thought - solstice is not for another few weeks - which I promptly pointed out to her. Turns out those are distinct phenomena.\nThe day after we meet at a cafe. Both intending to be there at 530 and both arriving an hour early to get some quiet time. Have I had the chance to figure out why it is that the sunset happens before the solstice? Not yet. We attempt and earth model with a yarn - it is entirely insufficient. I place my hypotheses:\nquestions # earliest sunrise then must happen before the summer solstice is it the case that latest sunrise would happen on the day of the solstice and starting from that, the day would start to increase? is the difference due to the elliptic orbit of the earth which has its longer radius that does not exactly match the \u0026ldquo;peak\u0026rdquo; position at the solstices? almost none are correct as it turns out We start plotting.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a sin wave for the sunrise. Starting at the fall equinox. going up (hours on the day) towards winter solstice and falling back down through \u0026ldquo;zero\u0026rdquo; towards summer solstice for its earliest (or so I think at the time) - point. Let\u0026rsquo;s call this one point of reference\n$$A_r \\cdot -sin(t) $$\nThen there\u0026rsquo;s the sunset line. Going the opposite way; as we know - a bit offset.\n$$A_s \\cdot sin(t+ \\theta)$$\nwith theta representing the radial offset with 2pi representing the full year. $A_s$ and $A_r$ represent the amplitude of the waves.. in the case that they are not identical\u0026hellip;\nFor all we know, this is not quite correct, either. in my mind I am thinking - I should be thinking of the elliptic orbit as a parametric equation and using that, since that\u0026rsquo;s my hypothesis.\nAlright then. // include plots as well\u0026hellip; so the function of our day length would be $$Base_s + A_s \\cdot sin(t + \\theta) - (Base_r - A_r \\cdot sin(t))$$$${Base_s-Base_r} + A_s \\cdot sin(t) \\cdot cos(\\theta) + A_{s*cos(t)}\\cdot sin(\\theta)+A_{r}\\cdot sin(t)$$ $$LengthOfDay = sin(t) * (A_s \\cdot cos(\\theta) + A_r) + A_{s}\\cdot cos(t) + const$$\nok I want to find min and max values of this function (or rather, the t values at which they occur). I am pretty sure to do that I\u0026rsquo;d want the derivative to be 0. Keep in mind that cos(\\theta) is a constant\n$$cos(t)\\cdot(A_{s\\cdot}cos(\\theta) + A_r) - A_{s\\cdot}sin(t) = 0$$ $$\\frac{sin(t)}{cos(t)} = \\frac{A_{s\\cdot}cos(\\theta)+ A_r}{A_s}$$\nneedless to say, I don\u0026rsquo;t get very far with my math. And, as it turns out - a lot of my initial assumption are wrong. However! We did find answers to our initial hypothesis even with the limited data and slightly generalized premises.\nThe converse of the statement \u0026ldquo;earliest sunset happens before the winter solstice\u0026rdquo; is in fact \u0026ldquo;latest sunset happens before the summer solstice\u0026rdquo; - rather than anything about sunrises, as their period is identical. Latest sunrise does not in fact happen on the day of the solstice. Rather, it happens about the same time after the solstice as the sunset extrema happens before. This got me thinking about matching rates of changes on the curves of the sunset/sunrise curves and whether their amplitudes might be different. follow-up # I got home and after some existential struggles I am currently going through (unfulfilling job etc) I decided to return to my question.

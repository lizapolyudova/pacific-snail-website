  Batiment7 been meaning to go check it out/do a workshop/tour, since it&rsquo;s so close to me. seems more like a community center, which is cool.

super responsive over email!
have gone to the &ldquo;supervised sessions&rdquo; at the ceramics studio and it was a wonderful time! Went with a friend, me got some clay and had a great time making for 3 hours or so.
Coming back in 3 weeks to paint our pieces after the first firings.
I think supervised sessions are running about every once a week

<p>
  <a href="https://www.les-affutes.ca/en/">LesAffutes</a>lots of cool workshops in both english and french. I&rsquo;ve gone for a woodworking thing as &ldquo;team building&rdquo; for work and that was super fun.</p>
<ul>
<li>woodworking workshop was very well organized. good safety techniques, ended up making a final product in just under 3 hours pretty cool!</li>
<li>did the basket weaving workshop. Met Katie, who made a really good note: the best part about these workshops is the fact that you come with all the materials prepared, everything is already setup for you.</li>

  Community Bike Workshops
  <a class="anchor" href="#community-bike-workshops">#</a>
</h2>
<p>For all the community bikeshops I&rsquo;ve been to (not a lot&hellip; but still) the general ethos is - the bikeshop is &ldquo;staffed&rdquo; with volunteers who will help you figure out what repairs are needed for your bike given that you come in with a specific issue and will likely guide you through the repair. However, it is generally expected that the person coming in is doing all the actual fixing themselves. I find this a wonderful way to learn and meet other bike enthusiasts</p>
<ul>
<li>
  <a href="https://santropolroulant.org/en/what-is-the-roulant/collectives/santrovelo/">SantroVelo</a> - every time I&rsquo;ve come in, the volunteers are extremely competent, knowledgeable and willing to help. Very well-stocked and organized. Last time I went: open Tue, Wed 530-730 PM, reservations are needed to come in. Costs 10$ for visit. They sell parts relatively cheap.</li>
<li>
  <a href="https://theflat.wordpress.com/">the FLAT bike collective</a> - located in the basement of McGill. Free to visit. Last time I checked was open Tue-Fri 530-730, but better check their website (or instagram which I think is more up to date) for schedule and any special events. Volunteers are largely students. From my experience not always expert advice, but always friendly and welcoming. Well-stocked if a bit chaotic in terms of organization.</li>

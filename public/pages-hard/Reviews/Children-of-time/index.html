Tactile language. Descriptions of the language are beautiful and haunting. Specifically, language reminds of it&rsquo;s existence with first encounter with a human - escaped prisoner from the crushed shuttle. The spiders comment on the inefficiency of speaking from the same opening that is used for eating (funny). The language also comes through in their understanding of the world - the universal web to refer to what humans in early 20th century would have thought of as the ether.">

<p>Tactile language. Descriptions of the language are beautiful and haunting. Specifically, language reminds of it&rsquo;s existence with first encounter with a human - escaped prisoner from the crushed shuttle. The spiders comment on the inefficiency of speaking from the same opening that is used for eating (funny). The language also comes through in their understanding of the world - the universal web to refer to what humans in early 20th century would have thought of as the ether.</p>

<p>Gender equality. Matriarchal society does not mean good, the level to which males are dehumanized and how the relationships evolve over time</p>
<p>Fascinating also is the decoupling of carrying offspring from being in a subservient position. Females are stronger and thus they succeed in the barbaric society, the tradition carries over because as we know oppressors are not interested in uplifting the oppressed.</p>
<p>Fabian’s power play in 5.4 is excellent, first explicit display of a demand for rights. It is likely worth drawing parallels between the plague and wwii for the US which caused many women to enter the workforce and change the narrative about the weaker sex,</p>
<h3 id="nature-of-guidance">
  nature of guidance
  <a class="anchor" href="#nature-of-guidance">#</a>
</h3>
<p>It is about agency, how directing oneself is a profoundly different experience from being directed, especially with determination and certsinty based on experiences entirely different from your own.</p>
<p>Humans in Holsten’s time, following examples of the ancients. Trying to catch up with the ever elusive past of infinitely sophisticated technology run into the same problems the ancients did - resource constrains, draining their natural environment. I guess externalities did not make it into the history books. They are guided by shadows of giants from the past.</p>
<p>Portia’s people, in the time following successful communication with the messenger, start to receive instructions on building technology clearly templated after ancient human technology, as well. It is counter to their nature to harvest metal or use it for their technologies and communications; yet, the force of having not just organized religion but a present live god, the creator be the command issuer makes resistance a strange and difficult task.</p>
<p>Finally,there’s Guyen creating a cult; possibly following in kerns steps, maybe not. His soliloquies about messianic ambitions of leading his people to the promise land might be true, might not be. I loved the Image of someone who sets up a cult on the premise that they are a god, goes into cryogenic sleep and then wakes up to being told they are s god. Over time, with enough iterations the delusion might take very deep.</p>

<p>In other somewhat related news to inferiority of genders and such, the book I am reading now established a matriarchal society with largely disposable male figures. The book traces almost a millenium of their societal evolution and eventually the females in charge come to terms with males having feelings and needs and being able to carry genetic information (for a while they believed only female bloodlines carried information in their proto-gene theory).</p>
<p>The point I am making. I found it kind of funny to start out with &ldquo;yeaaa women in charge! Powerful warriors who lead the clan&rdquo; but really it&rsquo;s quite horrific the way they fail to see humanity in the other gender (humanity lol. Technically spiders, but) so I&rsquo;ve been reflecting on that initial reaction, thinking about how easy it is to oppress the weak, how easy it is to assume only those striving for power are intelligent and brave.</p>

[{"id":0,"href":"/audio/audio-journaling/","title":"audio journaling","section":"Audios","content":"The idea with audio journaling is the same with journaling - explore your feelings in a freeform way; like musical improvisation, rather than composition.\nObservation # Get a recording device; ideally, not your phone, but phone is fine too. Just set it to airplane mode\nGo outside. Pick a setting you know well which inspires you or go to a new place.\nBe in that place, allow yourself to steep in the experience. Treat it as a test tube, notice details\nDescribe your surroundings as thought it were a painting.\nFind a strange looking thing, maybe an optical illusion your mind is playing. Describe what you are seeing and what you believe is creating the illusion.\nFeel the non-visual things; temperature, smells, humidity, sounds(!). Talk about them in as much detail as possible.\nFeelings # Get a recording device Wherever you are, press recording and start talking. I find that a familiar setting like a table where I eat breakfast or in bed under the covers makes me feel most vulnerable and reminds me of feelings that surround me Listen to your voice, how it cracks when you hold back the tears or the uncertainty you are facing with the long pauses. Acknowledge what feels untrue as it escapes your mouth. Physicality of sound will guide you. Once you feel released, re-listen to the recording. There\u0026rsquo;s a strange catharsis in hearing yourself in a vulnerable state, re-experiencing from outside the voice we reserve for those closest to us. Summary # Get a recording device; ideally, not your phone, but phone is fine too. Just set it to airplane mode Go outside. Pick a setting you know well which inspires you or go to a new place. Pick a point in the past and start talking about it. Take tangents as you need to. Follow-up # listen back to the recording when you are home do you sound anything like you do in your recorded meetings? are you shy or self-conscious? When do you speed up or slow down? can you close your eyes and imagine where you were experiencing the same words?

I think I finally somewhat understand declinations of the moon. Declination in itself is a simple idea: it\u0026rsquo;s the vertical angle between the (line doing directly up? Idk the name) So sun declination through the year ranges from 23N to 23S\nMoon is more sporadic due to its angled orbit. There\u0026rsquo;s an 18 year cycle which changes max declination from to 28.smth\nThis is such a good explanation for moon standstills (kinda fully cuz some quotes are in all caps, but gotta appreciate their dedication to lack of other types of emphasis) Some outtakes:\nmoon does in a month what sun does in a year ( in terms of it\u0026rsquo;s movement in the sky) there is an 18 year long cycle in which the \u0026ldquo;amplitude\u0026rdquo; moon monthly declination fluctuates (so 9 years between major and minor lunar standstill. Pictured above) https://www.umass.edu/sunwheel/pages/moonteaching.html\nSpecifically. You can think of it as: on years when we are close to a minor lunar standstill. No matter how hard the moon tries, it will always be kinda barely rolling along the horizon. Whereas on major standstill years each month the moon will have low and high days. Some higher than the sun could ever reach. Not trying to be dramatic, it just kinda comes out that way. I think we are close to a major standstill next year\nreferences # http://www.bajr.org/BAJRread/BAJRGuides.asp# (specifically [[archeoastronomy]] guide ) https://www.umass.edu/sunwheel/pages/moonteaching.html recommended reading # Ruggles, C.

Now I\u0026rsquo;ll have to finish the trilogy! They still have a few hundred years to go until they encounter the aliens. I was thinking more about scifi vs fantasy and I think they are pretty similar! Except scifi aesthetics sometimes make dreaming concepts very fun. It reminds me of getting high and doing my math homework. All those multidimensional structures coming into place, ready for me to think about them as I\u0026rsquo;m going to sleep. A core concept later in the book is making a computer out of a single proton. I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you about it next time. It\u0026rsquo;s difficult for me to comment on feasibility but it sure is fun to think about. I guess scifi has a lot of lore built-in which comes from high school/early college science classes.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/other/learning-french/","title":"Learning French","section":"Others","content":" Classes # "}]

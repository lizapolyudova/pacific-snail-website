Newgrange is a megalithic mound, a man-constructed &ldquo;hill&rdquo; made of layers of stone and dirt with a single passage aligned with the direction of the sunrise on the day of the winter solstice. The structure predates Stonehenge by approximately 2 thousand years and is located about 1 hour north of Dublin.
As a friend of mine put it

was it 3 people who were obsessed with stars? Were they the weird star geeks? Or was it the entire population. I like imagining a while population all evry organized diligently designing astrological ceremonial thing. But in reality most poeple were like &ldquo;LETS BUILD HUGE STONE AND EARTH THING and then the 1-2% of autistic/nerdy people got obsessed with stars and tracking dates and the other people were like . ok ok that seems like a cool idea and not much extra work. we&rsquo;ll turn the thing around to the point it in the direction you want&rdquo;">

<p>Newgrange is a megalithic mound, a man-constructed &ldquo;hill&rdquo; made of layers of stone and dirt with a single passage aligned with the direction of the sunrise on the day of the winter solstice. The structure predates Stonehenge by approximately 2 thousand years and is located about 1 hour north of Dublin.</p>
<p>As a friend of mine put it</p>
<blockquote>

I like imagining a while population all evry organized diligently designing astrological ceremonial thing.

</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, one can learn much about the prehistoric society; there are countless books, there&rsquo;s a categorization: Stone Age, Bronze Age, etc. Then each is further subdivided into eras with sufficiently distinct characteristics. Neolithic Age - the last part of Stone Age specifically differs from the one before it [Mesolithic] by introduction of agriculture, domestication of animals and a change from nomadic lifestyle to one that is settlement-base. All those should not come as a surprise - whether the knowledge is sources from middle school history books or games like civilization where skills are neatly laid out as a sequence to cross the Bronze Age threshold.</p>
<p>Yet, the question stands: we don&rsquo;t truly understand that society.</p>

</h2>
<p>I went to Newgrange on the day of the April New Moon in 2023. Took a bus in to Drogheda from Dublin the night before and stayed in a hostel. Was lucky to catch a wonderful couple spending their last evening of working at the hostel, moving on to continue traveling to County limerick near the Burren and Ailwee caves.</p>
<p>I remember meeting some folks at the hostel the night before - it was their last day, sharing some shells I picked up on beaches in count Kerry, since they were heading there next and it seemed like a fun idea to ask them to return a shell to the beach.</p>
<p>First thing on the next day I grabbed a taxi to the Newgrange visitor center, the appointment slot was at 9:30; there was morning traffic and people were getting to work - which seemed absurd in such proximity of a prehistoric site - life goes on.</p>
<p>I stand in front of the visitor center, 930 deadline seems like a joke now, what is time. I remember a woman in front of me; a face shaped with kindness - her face almost always half-smiling, wrinkles carrying the memory of joyful times of the past, flowing gray hair. We probably chatted for a while, I ran into her and her family a few more times, each time with small talk getting no less small but somehow warming over time.</p>
<p>Newgrange is place that affected me deeply when I went to see it. There are so many themes packed in here:</p>
<ul>
<li>changing from nomadic people to agriculture-focused society</li>
<li>tracking time with extreme precision without mathematics or a representative of reality astronomical model (really circling the word &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; here).</li>
</ul>
<p>I would really like to start exploring these themes in an essay, bullet points, or any other form, really. So far, I&rsquo;ve mostly spent my time exploring this conversation through casual conversation with people who care to listen and engage.</p>
<p>Reading:</p>

<p>Pilgrimage of everyday things.</p>
<ul>
<li>I met a woman who told me she picks up stones on the side of the highway and bring them back home to create a pathway in her frontyard</li>
<li>Newgrange is constructed specifically from stones which were brought over from &gt;50 km away.</li>
<li>Earlier that day, prior to hearing the story, I have given objects to new friends to be carried on a pilgrimage of their own. Who is to say whether they&rsquo;ve completed the journey, but the natural inclination is what is interesting</li>
<li>Then of course there is Ferdinand Cheval 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Cheval">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Cheval</a> (who told me about him?! was it someone at newgrange? was it Brian? or Paul? who is to say)</li>

<p>I am thinking about newgrange again. The room I am staying in is an attic apartment. Bed next to a diagonal roof window facing almost directly east. I wake up around 5 each day from the sun (going back promptly to sleep of course). Until 10 or so the sun framed by the window travels across the room. I only have a few more days, but I think I&rsquo;ll track how it progresses through the room, since I have my own personal. &ldquo;roofbox&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Maybe building of the temple was partly a testament to end of the nomadic lifestyle. Neolithic period (last part of the stone age) is when people started changing from nomadic hunter-gatherers to an agriculture-focused society. I wonder how they tracked the sun when moving from place to place, without the intricate sundials and standing stones. I can attest - sun still rises in the east, but it must have been with a lot less precision that they could predict the seasons changing.</p>

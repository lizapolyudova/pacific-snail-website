## outline

### introduction of the problem 
A friend introduced me to the idea that earliest sunset is a distinct phenomenon from the winter solstice. 

If you are not familiar with the winter solstice here's a quick refresher - it's the longest night of the year; and, conversly, the shortest day of the year. Human civilisation has observed the phenomenon for millenia and built structures (newgrange, others?) and celebrations (christmas, others?) around it. 
### why is it surprising?

Great question. Before we dive any deeper into *why* it happens I want to establish why the intuition dictates it should not be the case, examine our assumptions so to speak.


	* introduce implicit 2 sin waves model 
	* 0.1 possibly graph: showing that sin waves arise from elliptical orbits (tbd)
	* 1. graph: w/realistic montreal values (rise/set/daylength)
	* 3. graph: locked derivatives of: winter and summer solstice
### adjusting the model: the naive way
	* introduce the offset
	* display graphs 1 & 2 with the offset variable
	* but how would it arise from the elliptical orbit?
...?
### breaking the "sinusoid" assumption:
	* sunrise equation
	* http://www.solartopo.com/daylength-course-of-the-year.htm (especially closer to the equator)
### introduce day length being variable, explain why (include the video) or link to another post?
	* graph: original graph with dotted lines to represent start of "day"
	* graph: original graph with dotted lines to represent start of "solar midnight"
	* tbd: this is going to be a challenging thing to visualize I think 
### true vs human constructed values
	* is there such a thing as "earliest sunset"? no. it is purely a derivative of our existing calendar model 
	* whereas "shotest day of the year" aka solctice can be described in terms which do not involve arbitrary concepts from an artibtrarily defined calendar
### things I learned
## overall
As part of this, I also wanted to include graphs for my [solstice and surrounding events]({{< ref "solstice and surrounding events" >}}) page. I found [this answer on stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29917446/drawing-sine-wave-in-canvas) which creates a beautiful 

The plan would be to create a canvas for each formula and either create a shortcode or just directly call a javascript function which is defined in the library file attached at the top

Another alternative would be to use something slightly more extensible like [funciton plot](https://mauriciopoppe.github.io/function-plot/) javascript library; however, that would require figuring out how to import it into my scripts, since I cannot seem to get it to work "out of the box".

I got it to work! And been hacking away. The library is very pretty and I've been making graphs.

For now: parameterizing the equations by letting the user input their own values (maybe sliders is better?) It's a bit clunky, since ideally the parameters section would travel along with the user starting from the initial definition and live somewhere on the side... hmm...

#### introduction 
why? because it is suprirsing and unexpected. The general tone is one of discovery. 
maybe check out Julia's zines for inspiration of communicating complex concepts clearly

here are some blogposts I found which explain this too:

when I skim articles, I'll often skim to look at just the pictures as though they present an outline. Have your pictures tell the story on their own.

Do not get distracted by side-plots, such as explaining the calendar system or ? yea, that's the main one. Maybe a

 [Syllabus Project](https://syllabusproject.org/) 

It is a strange place on the internet. I initially encountered it as a wild goose chase learning about Adrienne Lily (maybe it was on her website)? 

Here are some favorites:
* first one, [Syllabus against story](https://syllabusproject.org/syllabus-against-story/) - many references to cool audio pieces as the author is the creator of the radio show [the blind tourist]({{< ref "the blind tourist" >}}); the gradient of more to less story is an interesting approach and makes one question the necessity of narrative

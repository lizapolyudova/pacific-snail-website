title: on happiness
---

```
My body feels exhausted, heart is open 
I catch my breath before, no action feels unfinished, overdue 
And overwhelmed with love I go on writing 
And when I feel like reaching out - I just do 
```


---


```
Moments of bliss - they call for nothing to be captured;
Ink stains the silence, passing thoughts remain unsaid

This morning on the train the sun awoke me - it was golden
And I am left to sit, observe and contemplate

```

---


```
Back of an empty bus, sun warming my left ear 
Radiating heat spreads out, further.
I close my eyes to let the heat sink in
Travel though body as streams flow through water

```

draft/raw notes:

There is enough time 

Bus. Back seat, sun on my left side. If I close my eyes and turn towards the window I take in the heat. 
Top window section is ajar letting cool air in. A woman brought sliced apples in a container, it reminds me of the comfort of bringing food and drink with me, like butter and sugar sandwiches. I first see her open the container and hear her eat the crispy slices. then the bus gets tiny drafts of mildly apple scented cool air. I close my eyes. 
Next stop is Lawrence station. I'm glad I exist.

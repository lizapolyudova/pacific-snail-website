```
Under a large tree
How do we process our travels
How do we share in a way which feels condenced?
Why not live-stream things as they happen?
Why does it drain the air for life to feel immense

Through time I always air travel
Through space - I float with wonder and with ease

Majestic baobab, how strange your forest sway
How comforting the roof you cast
(Though half man-made) over flat benches
So arranged in circle 
with whimsical green sprouts pouring out of your trunk
Do you believe that life is pre-determined?

Majestic baobab, you captivate with gentle grandness
Though tamed in walls of garden, you make your presence known

Your branches weave through space between each other
Many have stopped, I'm sure, to admire
The flowing static nature of your beauty
Many have stopped and sat as I am sitting now
Right across one of your faces

How could I dream to capture your elusive nature
How could I wish to keep that which is not made to be preserved
Against my better judgement - I attempt to
Strangeness at times best left to be observed
```

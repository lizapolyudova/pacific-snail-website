## quotes and points

### "crisis"
something I again found an interesting point at the start of the book is the acknowledgement that the "housing crisis" has been going on forsome time. specifically, usage of the word "crisis" is critiqued 

> the word crisis suggests something infrequent, surprising, and widely undesirable; something that leads to dire consequences unless it is brought under control ... It is fair to expect governments to act with resolve when dealing with real crises, swiftly deploying the resources and personel needed to stop the bleeding.

Examples provided are:
* COVID-19
* 2008 economic crisis
* Russian invasion of Ukraine

I think this is an interesting point, since I am not acutely aware of what the canadian government is currently doing to 
### supply and demand
In the first chapter the book makes an intresting point. The commonly cited "supply and demand" argument is not exactly disputed. It is however inspected futher.

> In the city of Toronto vacancy rates more than doubled between October 2019 (1.5) and October 2020 (3.4) ... The average rent rose by 4.7%

Which supply and demand do somewhat guide housing market in certain cases, they alone to not determine what is right.

There's also this comment on 
> another important difference between real-world rental markets and the law of supply and demand taught in economics 101 is that housing is not bananas. Bananas spoil quickly, so it is in the interest of sellers to get rid of the goods quicly even if it is at a price lower than they expected. Housing increases in value over time ... **when a new tenant agrees to pay a higher rent for years to come, then waiting pays off in a few months and the rest is profit** 

This is such a deep and uncomfortable thought. Vacancy rates in this sense are just indicators of landlords being too stubborn to bring down the price and instead holding out for a higher-paying tenant

## questions

- [ ] something I am curious coming to this book is whether enough nuance will be provided for the case of the landlords themselves. 
What I would be interested in is seeing economics-wise how interest rates affect mortgages and why landlords choose to let those be absorbed by the tenants directly rather than absorb some of the costs themselves. (well... we know why)

## intro / thoughts
The book is set in a fictional (not very distant) future in which a large tech (monopoly I think?) has developed a single general AI android which was quickly banned by most countries and no more will be made. At the same time, the world is filled with machines equipped with highly specialized AI which are fairly advanced.

Much of the narrative focuses on a remote island where our several protagonists attempt to make first contact with what is presumed to be a civilization of highly intelligent octopuses.

There's also two other major plot lines, which I will not mention here, but I found tie in nicely into the narrative.

I was concerned reading this as it contains two relatively "trendy" topics - AI and octopus intelligence. While I can't say I found revolutionary insights, it was a nice meditation on the nature of intelligence and consciousness. Considering the physically distributed nature of an octopuses nervous system, one cannot help but wonder whether human fixation on hierarchies might be in part due to mirroring our own biology.

As always, mild spoiler ahead; however, I do not think any of the notes here will hinder your enjoyment of the book should you choose to read it.

## thoughts
I love that this book is filled with quotes of a fictional book that makes me interested in the protagonist I would otherwise not feel as close to, this is a great example of 'show don't tell'; show me the lonely genius scientists feels a connection to the octopuses and really admires and believes in a world in which they build a culture by quoting her book, don't just tell me she cares - ingenious. 

I enjoyed how this book treated consciousness - simply. As a sort of delusion created by self awareness in which the subject of the delusion is sufficiently convinced by it.

> Evrin has asked the question 'Am I a conscious being?' and Evrin has answered, 'Yes' - that's all: when the machine asks the machine a question and answers it, fully convinced it is talking to itself, fully convinced it exists as a conscious entity, we have closed the loop 

While the android in question ends up being quite distirbed by this sentiment and sent into a brief existential depression, I do not find it offensive; but rather - quite a natural and succinct description of the concept of consciousness.

Above all, I appreciate how this books treats encountering a new, an alien society. While it does have some elements which very much reminded me of Ted Chaing's Arrival - the wonder of communicating with a mind that is nothing like ours, finding common touchpoints, general high-level philosophizing about the nature of language, how it must necessarily condence the native speaker group's world perception. There is something this book touches that the Arrival does not (in its defense... it was only a short story and a focused one at that) - a deep sense of empathy of how the other might see you, a deep sense of appreciation for the differences. 

The book first introduces the idea by referencing Thomas Nagel's ["what is it like to be a bat"](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~cavitch/pdf-library/Nagel_Bat.pdf) 

In the end, I found the book wrapped up in a somewhat rushed way. I did enjoy how the story lines intertwined with each other in the end, although I feel like the political intrigue was probably underplayed with the (spoilers) easy and unexplained death of the evil CEO and takeover of the territory by the monks. It seemed a bit like the author decided "ok, I'm done with the story, how do we give this a happy ending without writing too much more"

## themes

### incomprehensible nature of experience of others
something akin to high-definition empathy. You could have guessed this from the "what is t is like to be a bat" reference.
The theme is something that is carried over across the 3 main storylines: 
* biologist/android/war veteran (who are all loners in their own way trying to find way to communicate and understand each other)
* human vs octopus - most intensely experiences by Ha, our scientist protagonist. The intensely combines her inability to communicate effectively with other humans to the vast depth layers of misunderstanding there must be between her and the octopuses. And yet - she still attempts contact
* the hacker (Rustem) 
* the point-fives (virtual reality AI "buddies" designed to help people who are either struggling socially or "have lives that are too busy for another person" - half of a person who will always listen to you, appear to have a life but be available) were an excellent illustration of a society-level difficulty to connect with each other in spite of everyone pulling their own life and struggles
* slaves on the fishing boat - our protagonist Eiko resolves to care about other people. He (at first performatively in the spirit of this goal of caring) starts to listen to people, pay attention to them, remember details about them, focus his minds eye on their faces when he is sleeping. To become a version of himself who is incomprehensible to him.
### perceiving self as a threat
 Unrelated to the book, but related to the theme: can you recall the first time you had empathized with a creature you've neglectfully threatened by your presence? I don't mean to make one sound malicious, that's the thing about negligence. For me it was insects or spiders. Most of those - those creepy crawly things with many legs which sometimes would pop up on summer days after a long rain - maybe espacing a flooded gap in the wall, maybe from outside in search of a place they will not drown. Regardless - I spent many years paralyzed by fear and relying on a benelovent companion to rid me of the terrifying "thing"; I then had a prolonged encounter with someone who has taught me to empathize with them, who gave me an inner monologue to run through on their behalf. It's not like I've never heard of "they are more scared of you than you are of them"; it's another thing to tell to yourself "ah it's alrite; did you get startled? Where were you trying to get to? Maybe I should help you to get back out" (please not, if you are having an infestation please do not hesitate to call pest control; I am referring to just very small intrusions I can only attribute to confusion and being lost on the other party's behalf).

But where was I. Ah yes. Being perceived as a threat is an interesting thing - I don't consider myself a threat. When beautiful birds or squirrels are startled by my however I don't think twice about it - they are just skiddish. To be perceived as a thread by a conscious being who you have real power over, to see in yourself the harm you can do is a terrifying thing.

I think this book deals well with considering (even if soewhat at a distance) this feeling of being a threat to someone you have deep curiosity for and mean no harm to. Further complicated by the fact that not only are you *perceived* as a threat, but in a sense... their suspicions are justified and you very much are a threat to them. 

I don't consider myself particularly threatening, but this book has made me reconsider inaction and negligence as the primary drivers of harm we do to each other.
### language and symbols

This book goes a bit in circles explaining importance of symbols. Many of us first encounter this idea in some form of "did you know some societies have 50 words for snow" or "did you know that there are language which don't contain the color orange and thus people dont 'see' orange"

Which is obviously an interesting idea when you first encounter it. Being *relatively* fluent in 2 languages ans acquiring a third, one definitely sense how a language shapes one's though and creates somewhat of a feedback loop with this you feel and are able to describe with the language which will further intensify the experience. 

My further exploration of this topic came in the the form of reading [Metaphors we live by]({{< ref "Metaphors we live by" >}}) which is an excellent book which gives many examples and classifies them showing how largely language is derived from the physical, the sensory experience. 

There were not many "puzzles" (of which I was hoping there would be more), but even with the few examples, it was fun to see the scientists explain symbolism through another species' sensory experience. 
## quotes 

> They are like encyclopedias of the minds of dead devotees. Or maps of those minds. But the map is not the same as the territory

> Each language decided what has meaning - and what does not. As native speakers, we are born inside this pattern, this semiotic cosmos

> This society - what the call modern society, what we think of as the most important time the world has ever known, simply because we are in it - is just the sausage made by grinding up history 

## references

This is a strange type of fiction, one that blends reality and interesting factoids with its own theories so seamlessly it becomes almost believable.

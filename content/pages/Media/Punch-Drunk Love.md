### Punch-Drunk Love
[good article](https://cinephiliabeyond.org/punch-drunk-love/)
Ahhh it is strange but so wonderful, I loved every second of it. The overwhelming ever present noisy soundtrack that gets in the way of dialogue, the awkwardly composed lines that sound like they are from a badly written play, the anxious pacing and constant running of Barry.

I'll say first 30 minutes or so I thought this movie would be more relevant to me when I was younger, when I was going through all this awkwardness, responding "i don't know" to any question and just being this anxious depressed mess.Â 

But what a turnaround. Watching the protagonist grow into a mad force of honesty and anger is somehow both fulfilling and terrifying. The ease with which he admits things to Lena and the inevitably nonchalant way in which she accepts them... Strange and beautiful and so true.

I had not experienced that until very recently. If I had watched it earlier, I would have just thought the feeling is made up. I would have thought that the happy ending is forced and unrealistic.

<!-- I'm glad it's you who told me about this movie. You make me feel the same way, like the world is open, like I can just say things when they feel right and not be afraid -->

## intro/synopsis
The premise of the book is simple: a recently theater actor and director buys a house in remote countryside by the ocean in an effort to find peace and quiet away from London theater scene and all the drama associated with it. 
Serendipitously, he encounteres his long-lost first love and attempts to rekindle a relationship with her. The rest is history I suppose.

## thoughts

I did not at first feel like writing about this book. From the start, I found the protagonist laughable at best and really - quite despicable. Dull, self-aggrandizing, quite petty. For any genuine praise he managed to give to any of his "friends" in describing them, he would undoubtedly follow it up with many more back-handed compliments and many times outright insults. He seemed obsessed with youth and appearances. I dreaded spending 500 pages in his world.

Two things I found intriguing which had me continue: for one, the introduction did a lot to give away the plot, promising a love triangle and a dramatic turn of events (strange thing for an introduction to do; though, in retrospect, it did not really spoil the book at all); on the other hand - I was quite curious about the format: the voice seemed distinct recorded in the form of a journal-trying--to-be-a-memoir-trying-to-be-a-novel, it was a genuinely interesting way to do a character study I haven't quite seem before. First person - yes. But also, a constant feeling of the story being recounted backwards in small chunks, rather than flowing forward or backwards, like a series of tiniest flashbacks. The introduction also did much to promise me a Jungian psychology take (which lies in parallel with my current reading of some psychology materials), so I pushed on.

The book caught me almost by surprise as half-way through I found I actually was invested in the plot and the characters.

There is plenty of mysticism, what I perceive to be allusions to tarot (the fall as tower, briefly preceded by mandala-creation - temperance and the wild party - the devil. After which comes a star).

## spoilers
I would have to verify this theory, but I am of the opinion that Charles possibly just constructed the whole drama out of boredom. He is known to have written a few plays (if not successful), so clearly it would not be a far stretch to assume he'd try himself at a fictional story filled with many dramatic characters and their characteristic dialogue voices. 

My theory is first and foremost founded on the following two facts that I recall:
* Charles himself mentioning in "prehistory" that publishing is a funny thing; and whatever you write will be taken to be true
* and all of a sudden, his life seems to be out-of-nowhere populated with all the intruders you could and could not dream of starting with Rosina

To me I would imagine a sort of healing process through writing in which various people from his life are "personas" of the past he is invoking which are struggling against each other, pulling him in all dirrent directions.

Hartley is his anima - sick and forgotten, suppresed his whole life. Really, he is on a mission to heal her in order to access his true self and the shadow.

The introduction seemed to imply that it is James who is Charles' shadow. I find that suprirsing. If anything - I'd think that it was Ben. The ultimate non-communicator in his strange cast of characters.
## quotes
In the introduction, there is actually a quote from a different piece but I am including it here, since that's the context I read it in 

> when work is done as sacred work, unseflishly, with a peaceful mind, without lust or hate, with no desire for reward, then the work is pure.
> 
> but when work is done is done with selfish desire, or feeling it is an effort, or thinking it is a sacrifice, then the work is impure.
> 
> and that work which is done with a confused mind, without considering what may follow, or one's own powers, or the harm done to others, or one's own loss, is work of darkness.

originically Bagavad Gita(18:23-5)

What an odd introduction, too! The whole plot laid out right ahead of you, as though the road you are about to travel needs signposting so that you don't miss looking around lost in confusing of where to proceed.


## further reading
in my attempts to find like-minded intepretations, as well as more thoroughly researched pieces which would help to to open up the idea slightly more, I found the following:

I'm reading the 2023 edition (book was first published in 2003) which has a favorable introduction well-aware of the influence [VanderMeer](https://www.blogger.com/profile/08306056002963293934)'s work would find and the themes it would explore. 

It's always funny to read introductions like that; a retrospective masking as a soothsayer's tale, about the glories found later in life by the author, the nescent ideas which will later find development.

It does well to prepare the reader for the description-dense style, the perspective switch with each character and section. I am not sure if I've already written [on forewords]({{< ref "on forewords" >}}), how they can guide towards interpretations, how they lead your gaze, how they prompt anticipation for themes and imagery. When seen for the second time, the eye find comfort, a curiosity of recognition rather than spotting for the first time. I have grown to like the feeling of recognition.

## style 

### adventure game
There is something adventure-game like about the flow of the book. Constantly on a mission, constantly moving. Side-tracked by smaller quests which bend the narrative even closer to the main line. I suppose it is just the last section detailing Shadrach 

Accompanied by a resentful head (counting down the hours to his death) who will nonetheless be useful; unclear whether for plot alone or out of some morbid curiosity.

Characters come and go, fade as they typically would once they've fulfilled their plot functions. Creatures are unusually helpful as they would be to one on a "quest". 

### circles of hell
I should preface this with: I've never read Dante. But with the 3 parts laid out and the last being so intent of descending deeper and deeper, I cannot help but feel a likeness to the divine comedy. 

It also maybe reminds me a bit of [omori]({{< ref "omori" >}}) - descending into ones subconscious. Uncovering more layers. We are first faced with the idea of an underground at all. Then Nicola is astonished at the idea alone of a 10th floor. Then there's 30. Who is to say how much deepest this goes. 

There is even underwater/fish/being inside the beast analogy! Either this metaphor is from a culture or folklore set I am not familiar with or... there is a connection?
## spoilers


The body horror is strong. There is a scene in part 1 delivered from Nicolas' perspective about genetic "kits" in which he is constructing very short-lived creatures. No details are included, only his persistent feeling of "good" and "bad" creatures they've created.

We get a follow-up on the same scene from his sister's perspective. One of the creatures was a kitten, crying in pain from all the mishapen organs it had to struggle with, unable to walk or breate. 

I am deeply reminded on an episode of [Love+Radio called "Doing the No-No"](https://loveandradio.org/2016/12/doing-the-no-no/) - a powerful piece about genetic engineering which explore ethics of the people in control of the said engineering. (goddamn it... they don't make archives available; what a darn shame).

## themes 
### biodiversity 
In Shadrach's journey to the 30th level he encounters a creature which is an interactive map; he admires and ponders how a single mind can create creatures both so beautiful and so terrifying as those who mostly inhabit the world he is now in. 

I make two parallels from this: there is no clear "why" in biodiversity. Things arise out of need and function, to complement each other, to survive. 

The other follow-up is: the unseen creative work and the depths of horrible creations. I think it would be unfair to imply that any creative process is cruel, but it is certainly true that in making something beautiful one as a side effect makes plenty of things which are... Far from it. They are unappealing. Distasteful. They please no one and make one question their existence. It's a part of the process. A very large part of the process 

### body horror
There is something almost relatable about having dysphoria of your own form. To be born or made into a body which you despise and cannot escape. Which does not function correctly. To be confronted with the reality that you are effectively someone else's experience. 
We are offered a world we are progressively discovering filles with creatures like that. Creatures whose inner thoughts we never question and yet we are clearly presented with the evidence that they are sentient in every interaction which happens between a stranger and the protagonist. 

### infrastructure

Something which makes my opinion sway is the highly developed infrastructure at every level. 

I am not sure if I cannot suspend my disbelief for it
Or if it speaks very deeply to the desire of any alive creature to survive and prosper - no matter where. 

On the floor Shadrach is from there is a very organized pipeline of organs to be bought and sold. Then there's the train handing out parachutes to travel down to 30th level as a "shortcut". I think theres s dose of the absurd here. Trash? At this layer? What are they making the parachutes out of? Silk? Single use? How is this possible. 

This is the point at which I cannot decide whether suspending my disbelief is allowing someone get away with plot holes and lazy world building or.. whether it's more fun for me to imagine that there is a functional society which built for itself the necessary infrastructure to sustain itself and serve it's needs. An ecosystem which is a system whose only purpose is to do what it does. 

I think I prefer the latter.

### experimentation and planning

There are things I am making sense of.

Quin's explanation, the lack of planning. Quin and Nicolas both being quite careless in their experiments, aimless.

Shadrach's fascination with the map creature who he calls the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen. How iti fails to actually lead him to Quin. The map he receives from Rafter (explicitly mentioned that it's nothing like Quin's beautiful map); but - it works.

## premise
Soft science-fiction (or speculative fiction if you are feeling particularly pessimistic) set in a post-apocalyptic settings and includes events preceding it. 

The society we are in is highly economically fragmented, a strange caricature of the world we live in placing special emphasis on:

- corporate entities and their lack of ethics as well as a very successful self-portrayal as a force for good which will "take care of it's people"
- huge economic disparity: mostly shown as the stark contrast between the corporate-owned "compounds" and "pleeblands" for anyone not working for a corporation of immediately related to someone working for a corporation 
- genetic editing: the key technology developed in this world seems to be not IT but rather genetic splicing. Pigoons are an early animals we are introduces to - oversized pigs with some human tissue which are harvested for organ transplants. More horrors are to come as the book progresses. 
- mass extinctions. While overall ecological decay is hinted at, the world painted by the trilogy focuses most on the extinction aspect of human destruction of our planet.

### individuals morals are weaker than social environment and habit 
I am not sure to what extent Atwood intended for this to be a theme, but I certainly thought a lot about this, especially in book 2 in which characters are often in situations of having to adjust to new environments and become new people due to that. 

Is it man that a man defines his actions? 
Or do actions define a man?



### action precedes faith

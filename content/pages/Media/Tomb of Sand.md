I started reading this book after abandoning Babylon by R.F.Kuang with a lot of built up irritation. I cannot help but compare the two. 

The novel is meditative, slow. It reminds me of stories told by my grandmother - intertwining, sometimes without a clear moral as most stories are, but often finding tangents which attempt to give a wider view on life. 

A thought I keep coming back to as I'm reading this book is - you cannot live avoiding narratives you dislike. I remember being younger, discovering various tropes like: detached husband and a longing wife, being alone and lonely, a millennial American girl who likes baking and all things green, an unaccomplished and jealous someone wishing only to be better; I am sure many more who are not coming to me now, but experiences I tried to avoid rather than understand. This book is making me want to understand the experiences, think about all the things I've been avoiding being instead of admitting I am. 

There is a part where Ma comes to live with Beti. And it's maybe 20 pages of pure bliss. How they spend their time leisurely, how ma stays in the sun, how Beti gets to be motherly to her own mother. Then interrupted by Ma's renewed social life. 

There is an interlude which makes me start to appreciate interludes in this book and it's general style. A writer goes off to a cabin in the jungle to seek inspiration only to find she is surrounded by life - insects, mice. She is terrified and runs back. In the same way we all idealize and single out a component of an experience we desire without fully understanding what it might entail. Guests start coming to visit Ma, Rosie specifically breaking their bubble of intimacy, bringing her out of Betis sole influence. 

## quotes 
> Daily life drops a veil over what's actually going on. What's really been happening only becomes a parent when much of it has already occurred. 

> People don't realize you should let the speaker speak; that as they speak, they are untying a knot within them, and only then does the matter grow clear.

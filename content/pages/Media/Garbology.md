> working there has changed him, he says, compelling him to think about how he and his family live, what they buy, what they waste

Yea. In my [ideal world]({{< ref "ideal world" >}}) there are some informal educational excursions or job rotations which ask that every citizen participate in a part of society which is generally undesirable (think jury duty, but more widespread)
Working at a landfill would be one of such rotations. 

I think about my grandmother visiting and going shopping to an outlet. The sheer joy of choices. She is one of the most careful consumers Ive met. Not im sure because of the new wave environmentalism, but just out of habit. Getting fruit at the market, cooking all of the food, owning almost everything she needs, throwing away very little. 

My tendency at the time was to judge this indulgence in material goods as "overconsumption"; but is it? If everyone also only shopped for clothes like that - at a place with vibrant variety, only every few years, valuing every find, would that be such a bad place to be? 

Islands of overconsumption can exist. Arguably it's better for them to exist; otherwise - we are all one such island.

The question is, is such abundance of goods only enabled by the enormity of the comercial-industrial complex of the fashion. Industry?

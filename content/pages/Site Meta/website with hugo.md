#website

## mindset
Remember; your goal for now - is not to fill things up with content so it looks like "a lot". I think the goal should be to have things be approached one at a time.

1. Be able to publish the website with most things marked as "drafts"
2. figure out how to hook up my 3js animation ()

	* this is now working! I ended up using something similar to [this solution](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/my-tips-to-turn-a-github-wiki-into-hugo-website/21217) since I already have a copy-paste script. It does slow things down... maybe could be run only on modified files instead?
	* it is however unclear why they are not working on the title page :( Ah. possibly because the content is embedded instead of copy-pasted... I could just add a party to copy-paste or find a way to get hugo to use my "home" page as the landing page.
* in either case, this is working now! so that's super cool and I can head home :)[]()

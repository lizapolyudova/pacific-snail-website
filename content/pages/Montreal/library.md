Libraries need no introduction. They are the unsung hero of providing community and free (!) entertainment for the local population. 

Get your library card and go exploring! Here are some of my favorite libraries in Montreal


## Verdun / Sud Ouest

### Rejean Ducharme (metro Lionel Groulx)

Smallish-library, but very conveniently located only 5 minutes from the metro. Specialty rentals:
* garden tools, seeds

### Point Saint Charles (metro Charlevoix)

Also not the largest library, but it's the closest one to my house and consistently surprises me with the variety of things a library can loan (as well as Montreals' dedication to expanding the library network beyond books by starting to function a bit like a tool library as well)

Specialty items:
* external CD player (with read/write capabiities)
* knitting needles and crochet hooks(!)

### Saint Henri

## Other

### Marc Favreau - Rosemont (near the metro)

beautiful, newly renovated. With a gorgeous sunroom upstairs, next to the metro. Great collection of both books and CDs.

Downstairs is somehow always buzzing with children, maybe because they are next to a daycare or because

### Benny Library (NDG)

great anglophone selection, also situated right next to a large pool! So go get some books and take a dip afterwards (or the other way around).

The also have musical instrument loans and a lot of sheet music!

### L'octogone

giant library, a nice ride away down the canal or the river towards 


## Requests for purchase

I forget where I heard it first, but a librarian more or less was doing a call for people to request resources they wanted to borrow at the library!
As much as I love the montreal library... they don't have a lot of the books I'd like to read. 
Here's a running list of books I've made a request to purchase:

* Amusing ourselves to death (Neil Postman)
* Ecology of freedom (Murray Bookchin)

## Dance

* [Contra Montreal](https://www.contramontreal.org/)- contra is folk dancing originating in New England. Good vibes, great community. Happens about 2 times a month (except when they are off in the summer). Live music, so lots of great opportunities to learn about local trad scene. They also do open band nights every so often when you can come and play in the band for the dancers :) good practice if you are a jammer
* [Siamsa Ceili](https://www.siamsa.org/en/ceilis) - also folk dancing! but of the irish variety. Both line and square dancing. Similar vibes to contra, gathers a slightly larger crowd, happens about once every month except off season.

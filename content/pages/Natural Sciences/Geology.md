We went to the natural History museum to the hall of minerals and I once again find myself drawn to them. 

The idea of rock evolution is one that is very interesting. There are earlier minerals, composed of pure elements which emerged early in the history of the universe.
Then much later, rocks emerge as things oxidize when earth is gaining atmosphere. 

Currently listening to Planet Geo podcast. 

## terminology
Isogonic lines = imaginary line or a line on a map joining points on earths surface at which the magnetic declination is the same. Also called isogonal.

Secular variation = continuous drift in the intensity and direction of the earths magnetic field
